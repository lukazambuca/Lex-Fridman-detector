5,Lex Fridman," As you've said, you grew up in a forest in East Germany (this is what we were talking about off-mic) to parents who were artists. And now I think, at least to me, you've become one of the most unique thinkers in the AI world. So can we try to reverse-engineer your mind a little bit? What were the key philosophers, scientists, ideas, maybe even movies, or just realizations that had an impact on you when you were growing up that kind of led to the trajectory or were the key sort of crossroads in the trajectory of your intellectual development?",1900-01-01 00:03:31,said grew forest east germany talking mic parent artist think least become one unique thinker ai world try reverse engineer mind little bit key philosopher scientist idea maybe even movie realization impact growing kind led trajectory key sort crossroad trajectory intellectual development,1
6,Guest," My father came from a long tradition of architects, a distant branch of the Bach family, and so basically he was technically a nerd, and nerds need to interface in society with non-standard ways. Sometimes I define a nerd as somebody who thinks that the purpose of communication is to submit your ideas to peer review. And normal people understand that the primary purpose of communication is to negotiate alignment, and these purposes tend to conflict, which means that nerds have to learn how to interact with society at large.",1900-01-01 00:04:06,father came long tradition architect distant branch bach family basically technically nerd nerd need interface society non standard way sometimes define nerd somebody think purpose communication submit idea peer review normal people understand primary purpose communication negotiate alignment purpose tend conflict mean nerd learn interact society large,0

10,Guest," He did study architecture, but, basically my grandfather made the wrong decision; he married an aristocrat and was drawn into into the war and he came back after 15 years. So basically, my father was not, parented by a nerd, but by somebody who tried to tell him what to do and expected him to do what he was told and he was unable to. He is unable to do things if he's not intrinsically motivated, so in some sense, my grandmother broke her son and her son responded by—when he became an architect—to become an artist. So he built Hundertwasser architecture. He built houses without right angles. He built lots of things that didn't work in the more Brutalist traditions of Eastern Germany. And so he bought an old watermill and moved out of the countryside and did only what he wanted to do, which was art. Eastern Germany was perfect for Boheme because you had complete material safety; food was heavily subsidized, healthcare was free—you didn't have to worry about rent or pensions or anything, so—",1900-01-01 00:05:07,study architecture basically grandfather made wrong decision married aristocrat drawn war came back year basically father parented nerd somebody tried tell expected told unable unable thing intrinsically motivated sense grandmother broke son son responded bywhen became architectto become artist built hundertwasser architecture built house without right angle built lot thing work brutalist tradition eastern germany bought old watermill moved countryside wanted art eastern germany perfect boheme complete material safety food heavily subsidized healthcare freeyou worry rent pension anything,0

12,Guest," Yes and the other thing is it was almost impossible not to be in political disagreement with your government, which is very productive for artists, so everything that you do is intrinsically meaningful because it will always touch on the deeper currents of society—of culture—and be in conflict with it, and tangent with it, and you will always have to define yourself with respect to this.",1900-01-01 00:06:15,yes thing almost impossible political disagreement government productive artist everything intrinsically meaningful always touch deeper current societyof cultureand conflict tangent always define respect,0

14,Guest," He was actually not a thinker—he was somebody who only got self-aware to the degree that he needed to make himself functional. So in some sense, it was also in the late 1960s, and he was in some sense a hippie, so he became a one-person cult. He lived out there in his kingdom, he built big sculpture gardens and started many avenues of art and so on, and convinced a woman to live with him—she was also an architect—and she adored him and decided to share her life with him, and I basically grew up in a big cave full of books; I'm almost feral... and I was bored out there; it was very, very beautiful, very quiet, and quite lonely, so I started to read and by the time I came to school, I read everything until fourth grade and then some, and there was not a real way for me to relate to the outside world, and... I couldn't quite put my finger on why and today I know it was because I was nerd, obviously, and I was the only nerd around, so there were no other kids like me and there was nobody interested in physics or computing or mathematics and so on. And this village school that I went to was basically a nice school. Kids were nice to me. I was not beaten up, but I also didn't make many friends or build deep relationships; that only happened starting from ninth grade when I went to a school for mathematics and physics.",1900-01-01 00:06:43,actually thinkerhe somebody got self aware degree needed make functional sense also late sense hippie became one person cult lived kingdom built big sculpture garden started many avenue art convinced woman live himshe also architectand adored decided share life basically grew big cave full book almost feral bored beautiful quiet quite lonely started read time came school read everything fourth grade real way relate outside world quite put finger today know nerd obviously nerd around kid like nobody interested physic computing mathematics village school went basically nice school kid nice beaten also make many friend build deep relationship happened starting ninth grade went school mathematics physic,0

16,Guest," Yes, I basically read everything. So I went to the library and I worked my way through the children's and young adult sections and then I read a lot of science fiction. For instance, Stalislaw Lem, basically the great author of cybernetics, has influenced me. Back then, I didn't see him as a big influence because everything that he wrote seemed to be so natural to me. It's only later that I contrasted it with what other people wrote.",1900-01-01 00:08:08,yes basically read everything went library worked way child young adult section read lot science fiction instance stalislaw lem basically great author cybernetics influenced back see big influence everything wrote seemed natural later contrasted people wrote,0

18,Lex Fridman," Hesse, I love Hesse. So at which point did the classical philosophers end? At this point or in the 21st century, what's what's the latest classical philosopher? Does this stretch through even as far as Nietzsche or is this -are we talking about Plato and Aristotle?",1900-01-01 00:08:48,hesse love hesse point classical philosopher end point century latest classical philosopher stretch even far nietzsche talking plato aristotle,1
19,Guest," I think that Nietzsche is the classical equivalent of a shit poster. So he is very smart and easy to read and - yeah, but he's not so much trolling others, he is trolling himself because he was at odds with the world. Largely his romantic relationships didn't work out. He got angry and he basically became a nihilist.",1900-01-01 00:09:02,think nietzsche classical equivalent shit poster smart easy read yeah much trolling others trolling odds world largely romantic relationship work got angry basically became nihilist,0

21,Guest," I think it's a lack of self-awareness. At some point, you have to understand the comedy of your own situation. If you take yourself seriously and you are not functional, it ends in tragedy, as it did for Nietzsche.",1900-01-01 00:09:32,think lack self awareness point understand comedy situation take seriously functional end tragedy nietzsche,0
22,Lex Fridman," I think, you think he took himself too seriously in that tension",1900-01-01 00:09:42,think think took seriously tension,1
23,Guest," Yeah! And you find the same thing in Hesse and so on, this Steppenwolf syndrome is classic adolescence where you basically feel misunderstood by the world and you don't understand that all the misunderstandings are the result of your own lack of self awareness. Because you think that you are a prototypical human and the others around you should behave the same way as you expect them based on your innate instincts, and it doesn't work out and you become a transcendentalist to deal with that.",1900-01-01 00:09:46,yeah find thing hesse steppenwolf syndrome classic adolescence basically feel misunderstood world understand misunderstanding result lack self awareness think prototypical human others around behave way expect based innate instinct work become transcendentalist deal,0

26,Guest," No, I think that you are neither serious or not serious yourself because you need to become unimportant as a subject. That is, if you are a philosopher, belief is not a verb. You don't do this for the audience and you don't do it for yourself.",1900-01-01 00:10:28,think neither serious serious need become unimportant subject philosopher belief verb audience,0

28,Lex Fridman," Do you think then people like Ayn Rand believed sort of an idea of that there is an objective truth? So what's your sense in the philosophical? If you remove yourself as subjective from the picture, you think it's possible to actually discover ideas that are true? Or are we just in a mesh of relative concepts that are neither true nor false? It's just a giant mess.",1900-01-01 00:10:53,think people like ayn rand believed sort idea objective truth sense philosophical remove subjective picture think possible actually discover idea true mesh relative concept neither true false giant mess,1
29,Guest," You cannot define objective truth without understanding the nature of truths in the first place. So, what does the brain mean by saying that it has discovered something as truth?",1900-01-01 00:11:14,cannot define objective truth without understanding nature truth first place brain mean saying discovered something truth,0
30,Guest," So, for instance, a model can be predictive or not predictive. Then there can be a sense in which a mathematical statement can be true because it's defined as true under certain conditions. So it's basically a particular state that a variable can have an assembled game and then you can have a correspondence between systems and talk about truth, which is again a type of model correspondence. And there also seems to be a particular kind of ground rules. So, for instance, you're confronted with the enormity of something existing at all.",1900-01-01 00:11:24,instance model predictive predictive sense mathematical statement true defined true certain condition basically particular state variable assembled game correspondence system talk truth type model correspondence also seems particular kind ground rule instance confronted enormity something existing,0

There is an absolute truth in the fact that something seems to be happening.",1900-01-01 00:11:55,right stunning realize something exists rather nothing seems true right absolute truth fact something seems happening,0
32,Lex Fridman," Yeah, that's that to me is a showstopper.

37,Guest," Non-existence might not be a meaningful notion in this sense. So in some sense, if everything that can exist exists, for something to exist, it probably needs to be implementable. The only thing that can be implemented is finite automata. So maybe the whole of existence is the superposition of all finite automata. And we are in some region of the fractal that has the properties that it can contain us.",1900-01-01 00:12:30,non existence might meaningful notion sense sense everything exist exists something exist probably need implementable thing implemented finite automaton maybe whole existence superposition finite automaton region fractal property contain u,0

48,Guest, So there could be no relation in the why direction without asking for a purpose or for a cause. It doesn't mean that everything has to have a purpose or a cause. Right?,1900-01-01 00:13:32,could relation direction without asking purpose cause mean everything purpose cause right,0

52,Guest," This was when ended the monarchy and started a democracy.

53,Guest," At the same time, democracy failed in Germany and we got fascism as the result. And it burned down things in a similar way as Stalinism burned down intellectual traditions in Russia. And Germany, both Germanys, have not recovered from this. Eastern Germany had this vulgar dialectic materialism and western Germany didn't get much more edgy than Habermas. So in some sense, both countries lost their intellectual traditions, and killing off and driving out the Jews didn't help.",1900-01-01 00:14:16,time democracy failed germany got fascism result burned thing similar way stalinism burned intellectual tradition russia germany germany recovered eastern germany vulgar dialectic materialism western germany get much edgy habermas sense country lost intellectual tradition killing driving jew help,0

55,Guest," There's also this thing that in some sense, the low hanging fruits in philosophy were mostly wrapped. And the last big things that we discovered was the constructivist turn in mathematics. So to understand that the parts of mathematics that work are computation. There was a very significant discovery in the first half of the 20th century and it hasn't fully permeated philosophy and even physics yet.

57,Guest," Yes. So basically, Godel himself, I think, didn't get it yet. Hilbert could get it. Hilbert saw that, for instance, a counters set theoretical experiments in mathematics led into contradictions. And he noticed that with the current semantics we cannot build a computer in mathematics that runs mathematics without crashing. And Godel could prove this. And so what Godel could show is: using classical mathematical semantics, you run into contradictions. And because Godel strongly believed in these semantics and more then in what you could observe and so on, he was shocked.",1900-01-01 00:15:29,yes basically godel think get yet hilbert could get hilbert saw instance counter set theoretical experiment mathematics led contradiction noticed current semantics cannot build computer mathematics run mathematics without crashing godel could prove godel could show using classical mathematical semantics run contradiction godel strongly believed semantics could observe shocked,0

59,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 00:16:07,yes,1
60,Guest," And for Turing, it wasn't quite so bad. I think that Turing could see that the solution is to understand that mathematics was computation all along, which means, for instance, PI in classical mathematics is a value. It's also a function, but it's the same thing. And in computation, a function is only a value when you can compute it. And if you cannot compute the last digit of PI, you only have a function.",1900-01-01 00:16:07,turing quite bad think turing could see solution understand mathematics computation along mean instance pi classical mathematics value also function thing computation function value compute cannot compute last digit pi function,0
61,Guest," You can plug this function into your local sun, let it run until the sun burns out, this is it. This is the last digit of pi, you will know. But it also means there can be no process in the physical universe or in any physically realized computer that depends on having known the last digit of PI.",1900-01-01 00:16:32,plug function local sun let run sun burn last digit pi know also mean process physical universe physically realized computer depends known last digit pi,0
62,Lex Fridman, Yes,1900-01-01 00:16:47,yes,1
63,Guest, Which means there are parts of physics that are defined in such a way that cannot strictly be true because assuming that this could be true leads into contradictions.,1900-01-01 00:16:48,mean part physic defined way cannot strictly true assuming could true lead contradiction,0
64,Lex Fridman, So I think putting computation at the center of the world view is actually the right way to think about it.,1900-01-01 00:16:55,think putting computation center world view actually right way think,1
65,Guest, Yes. And Wittgenstein could see it. And Wittgenstein basically preempted the largest program of A.I. that Minsky started later. Like 30 years later.

69,Guest," If you read the Tractatus, it's a very beautiful book, basically one thought on 75 pages. It's very nontropical for philosophy because it doesn't have arguments in it and it doesn't have references in it. It's just one thought that is not intending to convince anybody. Thesis says it's mostly for people that had the same insight as me. Just spell it out. And this insight is: there is a way in which mathematics and philosophy ought to meet. Mathematics tries to understand the domain of all languages by starting with those that are so formalisable that you can prove all the properties of the statements that you make.",1900-01-01 00:17:24,read tractatus beautiful book basically one thought page nontropical philosophy argument reference one thought intending convince anybody thesis say mostly people insight spell insight way mathematics philosophy ought meet mathematics try understand domain language starting formalisable prove property statement make,0

75,Guest," And Wittgenstein was trying to make them meet. And he already understood that, for instance, you could express everything with the NAND calculus, that you could produce the entire logic to NAND gates, as we do in our modern computers. So in some sense, he already understood Turing Universality before Turing spelled it out. I think when he wrote the Tractatus, he didn't understand yet that the idea was so important and significant. And I suspect then when Turing wrote it out, nobody cared that much.

97,Guest," So I suspect that general intelligence is the result of trying to solve general problems. So intelligence, I think, is the ability to model. It's not necessarily goal directed rationality or something, many intelligent people are bad at this. But it's the ability to be presented with a number of patterns and see a structure in those patterns and be able to predict the next set of patterns, to make sense of things. And some problems are a very general, usually intelligence serves control, so you make these models for a particular purpose of interacting as an agent with the world and getting certain results. But it's... The intelligence itself is, in the sense instrumental to something. But by itself, it's just the ability to make models. And some of the problems are so general that the system that makes them needs to understand what itself is and how it relates to the environment. So as a child, for instance, you notice you do certain things despite you perceiving yourself as wanting different things.",1900-01-01 00:25:08,suspect general intelligence result trying solve general problem intelligence think ability model necessarily goal directed rationality something many intelligent people bad ability presented number pattern see structure pattern able predict next set pattern make sense thing problem general usually intelligence serf control make model particular purpose interacting agent world getting certain result intelligence sense instrumental something ability make model problem general system make need understand relates environment child instance notice certain thing despite perceiving wanting different thing,0

99,Guest," The true Turing test in a way is, you ask a system: what is intelligence? If that system is able to explain what it is, how it works, then you should assign it a property of being intelligent in this general sense. So the test that Turing was administering in a way -I don't think that he couldn't see it, but he didn't express it yet in the original 1950 paper- is that he was trying to find out whether he was generally intelligent. Because in order to take this test, the rub is, of course, you need to be able to understand what that system is saying.

And at this point it disappears. So we know of a second order law. And if you make thirty layers of these laws, then you have a description of the world that is similar to the one that we come up with when we describe the reality around us. It's reasonably predictive, it does not cut to the core of it. It does not explain how it's being generated, how it actually works.

160,Guest," And then we see that most of the domains of mathematics that we have discovered are in some sense describing the same fractals. This is what category theory is obsessed about, that you can map these different domains to each other. So they're not that many fractals.

166,Guest," It's basically a result of the purpose that the mind has. It's a tool for modeling, right? We are not actually monkeys. We are side effects of the regulation needs of monkeys. And what the monkey has to regulate is the relationship of an organism to an outside world that is in large part also consisting of other organisms. And as a result, it basically has regulation targets that it tries to get to. These regulation targets start with priors, they are basically like unconditional reflexes that we are more or less born with, and then we can reverse engineer them to make them more consistent.",1900-01-01 00:45:03,basically result purpose mind tool modeling right actually monkey side effect regulation need monkey monkey regulate relationship organism outside world large part also consisting organism result basically regulation target try get regulation target start prior basically like unconditional reflex le born reverse engineer make consistent,0
167,Guest," And then we get more detailed models about how the world works and how to interact with it. And so these priors that you commit to a largely target values that our needs should approach, set points, and this deviation to the set point creates some urge, some tension.

It's a dimension that you care about, you think is important. And this is also what locks you in. If you let go of these commitments, of these identifications, you get free.

There are also things that I might perceive about you that you don't perceive. But in some sense, both you and me are some puppets, two puppets that enact this play in my mind. And I identify with one of them because I can control one of the puppet directly. And with the other one I can create things in between. So, for instance, we can go in and interact and that even leads to a coupling, to a feedback loop, so we can think things together in a certain way or feel things together. But this coupling is itself not a physical phenomenon, is entirely a software phenomenon. It's the result of two different implementations interacting with each other.",1900-01-01 00:48:23,exist almost similar way internal state le accessible model might completely adequate also thing might perceive perceive sense puppet two puppet enact play mind identify one control one puppet directly one create thing instance go interact even lead coupling feedback loop think thing together certain way feel thing together coupling physical phenomenon entirely software phenomenon result two different implementation interacting,0
176,Lex Fridman," So that's interesting. So are you suggesting ...I'd... Like the way you think about it... Is the entirety of existence a simulation and we're kind of each mind is a little sub-simulation? That like, why don't you, why doesn't your mind have access to my mind's full state? Like...

So if you build a system, any kind of automaton, so if you build simulations of something, you'll notice that the phenomena that endure are those that give rise to stable dynamics. So basically, if you see anything that is complex in the world, it's the result usually of some control of some feedback that keeps it stable around certain attractors.

208,Guest," I think that consciousness is largely a model of the contents of your attention. It's a mechanism that has evolved for a certain type of learning. At the moment, our machine learning systems largely work by building chains of weighted sums of real numbers for some non-linearity. And you learn by piping in error signals through these different chained layers and adjusting the weights and these weighted sums.

209,Guest," Basically, the arrow is piped backwards into the system until it accumulates at certain junctures in the network and everything else evens out statistically. And only at this juncture, this is where you had the actual error in the network, you make the change there.

210,Guest," We pinpoint the probable region in the network where we can make an improvement, and then we store the this binding state together with the expected outcome in a protocol. And this ability to make indexed memories for the purpose of learning to revisit these commitments later. This requires a memory of the contents of our attention. Another aspect is when I construct my reality, I make mistakes. So I see things that turn out to be reflections or shadows and so on, which means I have to be able to point out which features of my perception gave rise to a present construction of reality.",1900-01-01 00:58:05,pinpoint probable region network make improvement store binding state together expected outcome protocol ability make indexed memory purpose learning revisit commitment later requires memory content attention another aspect construct reality make mistake see thing turn reflection shadow mean able point feature perception gave rise present construction reality,0
211,Guest," So the system needs to pay attention to the features that are currently in its focus. And it also needs to pay attention to whether it pays attention itself, in part because the attentional system gets trained with the same mechanism, so it's reflexive. But also in part because your attention lapses if you don't pay attention to the attention itself. Right? So is the thing that I'm currently seeing, just a dream that my brain has spun off into some kind of daydream? Or am I still paying attention to my percept?",1900-01-01 00:58:41,system need pay attention feature currently focus also need pay attention whether pay attention part attentional system get trained mechanism reflexive also part attention lapse pay attention attention right thing currently seeing dream brain spun kind daydream still paying attention percept,0
212,Guest," So you have to periodically go back and see whether you're still paying attention and if you have this loop and you make it tight enough between the system becoming aware of the contents of its attention and the fact that it's paying attention itself and makes attention the object of its attention, I think this is the loop over which we wake up.",1900-01-01 00:59:09,periodically go back see whether still paying attention loop make tight enough system becoming aware content attention fact paying attention make attention object attention think loop wake,0
213,Lex Fridman," So there's this... So there's this attentional mechanism that's somehow self-referential that's fundamental to our consciousnesses. So I'll just ask you a question. I don't know how much you're familiar with the recent breakthroughs in natural language processing. They use attentional mechanisms, use something called Transformer's to learn patterns and sentences by allowing the network to focus its attention to particular parts of the sentence and each individual. So like parametrised and make it learnable the dynamics of a sentence by having like a little window into the into the sentence.",1900-01-01 00:59:25,attentional mechanism somehow self referential fundamental consciousness ask question know much familiar recent breakthrough natural language processing use attentional mechanism use something called transformer learn pattern sentence allowing network focus attention particular part sentence individual like parametrised make learnable dynamic sentence like little window sentence,1

215,Guest," Not quite. I think it models only one aspect of attention. In the early days of automated language translation, there was an example that I find particularly funny where somebody tried to translate a text from English into German and it was a bat broke the window. And the translation in German was Eine Fledermaus zerbrach das Fenster mit einem Baseballschläger. So to translate back into English a bat, this flying mammal broke the window with a baseball bat.",1900-01-01 01:00:16,quite think model one aspect attention early day automated language translation example find particularly funny somebody tried translate text english german bat broke window translation german eine fledermaus zerbrach da fenster mit einem baseballschlger translate back english bat flying mammal broke window baseball bat,0
216,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:00:48,yes,1
217,Guest, And it seemed to be the most similar to this program because it somehow maximized the possibility of translating the concept bat into German in the same sentence.,1900-01-01 01:00:48,seemed similar program somehow maximized possibility translating concept bat german sentence,0
218,Guest, And this is a mistake that the transformer model is not doing because it's tracking identity. And the attentional mechanism in the transformer model is basically putting its finger on individual concepts and make sure that these concepts pop up later in the text.,1900-01-01 01:00:59,mistake transformer model tracking identity attentional mechanism transformer model basically putting finger individual concept make sure concept pop later text,0
219,Lex Fridman, Yeah.,1900-01-01 01:01:14,yeah,1
220,Guest," And tracks basically the individuals through the text. And it's why the system can learn things that other systems couldn't before it, which makes it, for instance, possible to write a text where it talks about a scientist and the scientist has a name and has a pronoun and it gets a consistent story about that thing.",1900-01-01 01:01:14,track basically individual text system learn thing system make instance possible write text talk scientist scientist name pronoun get consistent story thing,0
221,Guest," What it does not do, it doesn't fully integrate this. So its meaning falls apart at some point. It loses track of this context. It does not yet understand that everything that it says has to refer to the same universe. And this is where this thing falls apart. But the attention in the transformer model does not go beyond tracking identity. And tracking identity is an important part of attention, but it's a different, very specific attentional mechanism. And it's not the one that gives rise to the type of consciousness that we have.",1900-01-01 01:01:31,fully integrate meaning fall apart point loses track context yet understand everything say refer universe thing fall apart attention transformer model go beyond tracking identity tracking identity important part attention different specific attentional mechanism one give rise type consciousness,0

226,Lex Fridman, So space of concepts so..,1900-01-01 01:02:10,space concept,1
227,Guest," Yes. And it can also be in a nominal sense or in lexical sense that you say, this word does not only refer to this class of objects, but it refers to a definite object to some kind of agent that waves their way through the story and is only referred by different ways in the language. So the language is basically a projection from a conceptual representation, from a scene that is evolving into discrete string of symbols. And what a transformer is able to do, it learns aspects of this projection mechanism that other models couldn't learn.",1900-01-01 01:02:12,yes also nominal sense lexical sense say word refer class object refers definite object kind agent wave way story referred different way language language basically projection conceptual representation scene evolving discrete string symbol transformer able learns aspect projection mechanism model learn,0
228,Lex Fridman," So have you ever seen artificial intelligence or any kind of construction idea that allows for unlike neural networks or perhaps within neural networks, that's able to form something where the space of concepts continues to be integrated? So what you're describing... Building a knowledge base, building this consistent larger and larger set of ideas that would then allow for deeper understanding?",1900-01-01 01:02:49,ever seen artificial intelligence kind construction idea allows unlike neural network perhaps within neural network able form something space concept continues integrated describing building knowledge base building consistent larger larger set idea would allow deeper understanding,1

234,Guest," And Cyc is a productive project. It's just probably not one that is going to converge to general intelligence.

235,Guest," So images play an important role in Tractatus, the Tractatus, an attempt to basically turn philosophy into logical probing language. To design a logical language in which you can do actual philosophy, that is rich enough for doing this. And the difficulty was to deal with perceptual content. And eventually I think he decided that he was not able to solve it. And I think this preempted the failure of the largest program in A.I.

236,Guest," There are functions, geometric functions, that we learn to approximate, that cannot be efficiently expressed and computed in a grammatical language.

242,Guest," So I think that language is a particular way or the natural language that we are using at a particular level of abstraction that we use to communicate with each other. But the languages in which we express geometry are not grammatical languages in the same sense. So they work slightly different, they're more general expressions of functions. And I think the general nature of a model is, you have a bunch of parameters, these are... have arranged, these are the variances of the world. And you have relationships between them, which are constraints which say if certain parameters have these values, then other parameters have to have the following values.",1900-01-01 01:05:35,think language particular way natural language using particular level abstraction use communicate language express geometry grammatical language sense work slightly different general expression function think general nature model bunch parameter arranged variance world relationship constraint say certain parameter value parameter following value,0
243,Guest," And this is a very early insight in computer science. And I think the some of the earliest formulations is the Boltzmann machine.

Because as soon as you add more than trivially a few elements, parameters into the system, it's very difficult to get it settled in the right architecture.

245,Guest," So now he built a network of small of these primitive Boltzmann machines. And in some sense you can see almost continuous development from this to the deep learning models that we are using today. Even though we don't use Boltzmann machines at this point.

246,Guest," I think it's a very general way of thinking about models, but we have to use a different approach to make it work.

248,Guest," Yes. So that's the direction in which I think our research is going to go. It's going to, for instance, what you notice in perception is: our perceptional models of the world are not probabilistic, but possiballistic, which means you should be able to perceive things that are improbable but possible. Right? Perceptual state is valid, not if it's probable, but if it's possible, if it's coherent.",1900-01-01 01:07:53,yes direction think research going go going instance notice perception perceptional model world probabilistic possiballistic mean able perceive thing improbable possible right perceptual state valid probable possible coherent,0

I don't think that people with prosopagnosia have per se a defective brain, the brain just has an average attention for faces.

290,Guest," I try to find out what people mean by spirit. When people say spirituality in the U.S., it usually refers to the phantom limb that they develop in the absence of culture. And a culture is in some sense, you could say, the spirit of a society that is long game.

318,Guest," And this only changed with the Enlightenment and the subsequent industrial revolution and in some sense, the Enlightenment freed our rationality and also freed our norms from the pre-existing order gradually. It was a process that basically happened in feedback loops so it was not that just one caused the other, it was a dynamic that started. And the dynamic worked by basically increasing productivity to such a degree that we could feed all of our children. And I think the definition of poverty is that you have as many children as you can feed before they die.

323,Lex Fridman, Right.,1900-01-01 01:21:32,right,1
324,Guest," So the reason why we don't have as many children as we want is because we also have to pay a price in terms of, we have to insert ourselves in a lower social tritonus if we have too many. So basically, everybody in the under, middle and lower upper class has only a limited number of children because having more of them would mean a big economic hit to the individual families.",1900-01-01 01:21:33,reason many child want also pay price term insert lower social tritonus many basically everybody middle lower upper class limited number child would mean big economic hit individual family,0
325,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:21:54,yes,1
326,Guest," Because children, especially in the U.S., are super expensive to have. And you only are taken out of this if you are basically super rich or if you are super poor. If you are super poor, it doesn't matter how many kids you have because your status is not going to change. And these children are largely not going to die of hunger.",1900-01-01 01:21:54,child especially u super expensive taken basically super rich super poor super poor matter many kid status going change child largely going die hunger,0
327,Lex Fridman, So how does this lead us to self-destruction? So there's a lot of unpleasant properties about this process.,1900-01-01 01:22:11,lead u self destruction lot unpleasant property process,1
328,Guest," So basically what we try to do is we try to let our children survive even if they have diseases. Like, I would have died before my mid 20s without modern medicine and most of my friends would have, as well. So many of us wouldn't live without the advantages of modern medicine and modern industrialised society. We get our protein largely by subduing the entirety of nature.",1900-01-01 01:22:16,basically try try let child survive even disease like would died mid without modern medicine friend would well many u live without advantage modern medicine modern industrialised society get protein largely subduing entirety nature,0
329,Guest," Now, imagine there would be some very clever microbe that would live in our organisms and would completely harvest them and change them into a thing that is necessary to sustain itself. And it would discover that, for instance, brain cells are kind of edible, but they're not quite nice. So you need to have more fat in them and you turn them into more fat cells. And basically this big organism would become a vegetable that is barely alive and it's going to be very brittle and not resilient when the environment changes.",1900-01-01 01:22:44,imagine would clever microbe would live organism would completely harvest change thing necessary sustain would discover instance brain cell kind edible quite nice need fat turn fat cell basically big organism would become vegetable barely alive going brittle resilient environment change,0
330,Lex Fridman," Yeah, but the...the... Some part of that organism, the one that's actually doing all the using of the... there will still be somebody thriving.",1900-01-01 01:23:13,yeah part organism one actually using still somebody thriving,1
331,Guest," So it relates back to this original question. I suspect that we are not the smartest thing on this planet. I suspect that basically every complex system has to have some complex regulation, if it depends on feedback loops. And so, for instance, it's likely that we should ascribe a certain degree of intelligence to plants. The problem is that plants don't have a nervous system, so they don't have a way to telegraph messages over large distances almost instantly in the plant.",1900-01-01 01:23:22,relates back original question suspect smartest thing planet suspect basically every complex system complex regulation depends feedback loop instance likely ascribe certain degree intelligence plant problem plant nervous system way telegraph message large distance almost instantly plant,0
332,Guest," And instead they will rely on chemicals between adjacent cells, which means the signal processing speed depends on the signal processing with the rate of a few millimeters per second. And as a result, if the plant is intelligent, it's not going to be intelligent at similar timescales as us.",1900-01-01 01:23:52,instead rely chemical adjacent cell mean signal processing speed depends signal processing rate millimeter per second result plant intelligent going intelligent similar timescales u,0
333,Lex Fridman," Yeah, brilliantly put. So the timescales is different. So you suspect we might not be the most intelligent, but we're... We're the most intelligent in this [...]scale... In our timescale.",1900-01-01 01:24:10,yeah brilliantly put timescales different suspect might intelligent intelligent scale timescale,1
334,Guest," So basically, if you would zoom out very far, you might discover that there have been intelligent ecosystems on the planet that existed for thousands of years in an almost undisturbed state. And it could be that these ecosystems activity related their environments. So basically changed the course of the evolution within this ecosystem to make it more efficient and as brittle.",1900-01-01 01:24:21,basically would zoom far might discover intelligent ecosystem planet existed thousand year almost undisturbed state could ecosystem activity related environment basically changed course evolution within ecosystem make efficient brittle,0
335,Lex Fridman," So its possible that something like plants is actually a set of living organisms, an ecosystem of living organisms that are just operating in a different timescale and are far superior in intelligent as human beings. And then human beings will die out and plants will still be there and they'll be there.",1900-01-01 01:24:42,possible something like plant actually set living organism ecosystem living organism operating different timescale far superior intelligent human being human being die plant still,1
336,Guest," Yeah, they also... There is an evolutionary adaptation playing a role at all of these levels. For instance, if mice don't get enough food and get stressed, the next generation of mice will be more sparse and more scrawny. And the reason for this is: because the ...In a natural environment the mice have probably hit a drought or something else. And if they're overgraze, then all the things that sustain them might go extinct and there will be no mice a few generations from now.",1900-01-01 01:24:58,yeah also evolutionary adaptation playing role level instance mouse get enough food get stressed next generation mouse sparse scrawny reason natural environment mouse probably hit drought something else overgraze thing sustain might go extinct mouse generation,0
337,Guest," So to make sure that there will be mice in five generations from now, basically the mice scale back. And a similar thing happens with the predators of mice. They should make sure that the mice don't completely go extinct. So in some sense, if the predators are smart enough, they will be tasked with shepherding their food supply.",1900-01-01 01:25:24,make sure mouse five generation basically mouse scale back similar thing happens predator mouse make sure mouse completely go extinct sense predator smart enough tasked shepherding food supply,0
338,Guest, And maybe the reason why lions have much larger brains than antelopes is not so much because it's so hard to catch an antelope as opposed to run away from the lion. But the lions need to make complex models of their environment. More complex than the antelopes.,1900-01-01 01:25:43,maybe reason lion much larger brain antelope much hard catch antelope opposed run away lion lion need make complex model environment complex antelope,0
339,Lex Fridman," So first of all, just describing that there's a bunch of complex systems and human beings may not even be the most special or intelligent of those complex systems, even on Earth, makes me feel a little better about the extinction of human species that we're talking about.",1900-01-01 01:25:57,first describing bunch complex system human being may even special intelligent complex system even earth make feel little better extinction human specie talking,1

342,Guest," The big stain on evolution is not us, it was trees.",1900-01-01 01:26:16,big stain evolution u tree,0
343,Guest, Earth evolved trees before they could be digested again. Right? There were no insects that could break all of them apart. Cellulose is so robust that you cannot get all of it with microorganisms. So many of these trees fell into swamps and all this carbon became inert and could no longer be recycled into organisms. And we are the species that is destined to take care of that.,1900-01-01 01:26:20,earth evolved tree could digested right insect could break apart cellulose robust cannot get microorganism many tree fell swamp carbon became inert could longer recycled organism specie destined take care,0
344,Lex Fridman, So this is kind of...,1900-01-01 01:26:40,kind,1
345,Guest," Dig it out of the ground, put it back into the atmosphere and the earth is already greening. So within a million years or so when the ecosystems have recovered from the rapid changes that they're not compatible with right now, the earth is going to be awesome again.",1900-01-01 01:26:42,dig ground put back atmosphere earth already greening within million year ecosystem recovered rapid change compatible right earth going awesome,0

348,Lex Fridman," .. well, see ...More phones than bones...I like it. But then let me push back. Uh... You've kind of suggested that we have a very narrow definition of... of intelli... I mean, why aren't trees more general ... A higher level of general intelligence?",1900-01-01 01:27:09,well see phone bone like let push back uh kind suggested narrow definition intelli mean tree general higher level general intelligence,1
349,Guest," If trees were intelligent then they would be at different time scales, which means within a hundred years, the tree is probably not going to make models that are as complex as the ones that we make in ten years.",1900-01-01 01:27:26,tree intelligent would different time scale mean within hundred year tree probably going make model complex one make ten year,0

351,Guest," You could say, the entirety of life did it. You know, the first cell never died. The first cell only split. Right? And ever divided.

354,Guest," So nevertheless, this Hyper-organism. No, the.. This little particular branch of it, which is us humans, because the industrial revolution and maybe the exponential growth of technology might somehow destroy our cells. So what what do you think is the most likely way we might destroy our cells? So some people worry about genetic manipulation. Some people, as we've talked about, worry about either dumb artificial intelligence or super intelligent artificial intelligence destroying us. Some people worry, well... Nuclear weapons and weapons of war in general.",1900-01-01 01:28:06,nevertheless hyper organism little particular branch u human industrial revolution maybe exponential growth technology might somehow destroy cell think likely way might destroy cell people worry genetic manipulation people talked worry either dumb artificial intelligence super intelligent artificial intelligence destroying u people worry well nuclear weapon weapon war general,0

357,Guest, So it's very likely that nothing that be bet on matters after we win our bets. So I don't think that bets are literally the right thing... way to go about this.,1900-01-01 01:28:51,likely nothing bet matter win bet think bet literally right thing way go,0
358,Lex Fridman," I mean, once you're dead, it doesn't mean you won't be there to collect the ... winnings.",1900-01-01 01:29:00,mean dead mean collect winning,1
359,Guest, So it's also not clear if we as a species go extinct. But I think that our present civilization is not sustainable. So the thing that will change is: there will be probably fewer people on the planet than are today.,1900-01-01 01:29:04,also clear specie go extinct think present civilization sustainable thing change probably fewer people planet today,0
360,Guest," And even if not, then still, most of people that are alive today will not have offspring 100 years from now because of the geographic changes and so on and the changes in the food supply.

But what he is doing, what a lot of people throughout history, since the Industrial Revolution are doing are just doing a lot of different technological innovation with some kind of target.

I think it's an incredible mechanism that has a huge impact on society by doing exactly what you're doing... oh sorry, doing exactly what you described, which is having this... Well, like, is this some kind of game and we're kind of individuals RL agents in this game and it's uncontrollable because there's not really a centralized control.

406,Guest," So I wouldn't give advice, because I am certainly not an expert, but I can give my thoughts on this. And I ... Our brain is... has solved this problem to some degree, right? Our brain has lots of individual agents that manage to play together in a way.

407,Guest," So imagine that you have something like Reddit or something like Facebook and something like Twitter, and you think about what they have in common. What they have in common: they're companies that in some sense own a protocol. And this protocol is imposed on a community.

408,Guest," And now imagine that you take these components of the protocol apart and you do it in some sense like communities within this social network. And these communities are allowed to mix and match their protocols and design new ones. So, for instance, the UI and the UX can be defined by the community. The rules for sharing content across communities can be defined. The monetization can be redefined. The way you reward individual users for what, can be redefined. The way users can represent themselves to each other can be redefined and...",1900-01-01 01:39:59,imagine take component protocol apart sense like community within social network community allowed mix match protocol design new one instance ui ux defined community rule sharing content across community defined monetization redefined way reward individual user redefined way user represent redefined,0

410,Guest," This itself can become part of the protocol. So, for instance, it could be in some communities it will be a single person that comes up with these things and other it's a group of friends. Some might implement a voting scheme that has some interesting weighted voting. Who knows? Who knows what will be the best self organizing principle for this?",1900-01-01 01:40:36,become part protocol instance could community single person come thing group friend might implement voting scheme interesting weighted voting know know best self organizing principle,0

412,Guest," It can be automated, so people can write software for this. And eventually the idea is: let's not make an assumption about this thing if you don't know what the right solution is. In those areas that you have no idea whether the right solution will be people designing this ad hoc, or machines doing this, whether you want to enforce compliance by social norms like Wikipedia, or with software solutions, or with A.I. that goes through the posts of people, or with a legal principle and so on - this is something maybe you need to find out.",1900-01-01 01:40:56,automated people write software eventually idea let make assumption thing know right solution area idea whether right solution people designing ad hoc machine whether want enforce compliance social norm like wikipedia software solution go post people legal principle something maybe need find,0
413,Guest," And so the idea would be, if you let the communities evolve.. And you just control it in such a way that you are incentivizing the more sentient communities, the ones that produce the most interesting behaviors and that allow you to interact in the most helpful ways to the individuals, right? So you have a network that gives you information that is relevant to you. It helps you to maintain relationships to others in healthy ways. It allows you to build teams.",1900-01-01 01:41:27,idea would let community evolve control way incentivizing sentient community one produce interesting behavior allow interact helpful way individual right network give information relevant help maintain relationship others healthy way allows build team,0

415,Lex Fridman," Yes, beautifully put. So but the key process of that with incentives and evolution is things that don't adapt themselves to effectively get the incentives have to die. And the thing about social media is communities that are unhealthy or whatever you want to define as the incentives really don't like dying. One of the things that people really get aggressive... Protests aggressively is when they're censored, especially in America. I don't know... I don't know much about the rest of the world, but the idea of freedom of speech, the idea of censorship is really painful in America. And so. What yeah, what do you think about that, having grown up in East Germany? What... Do you think censorship is an important tool in our brain, in the intelligence and in the social networks? So basically, if you're not a good member of the entirety of the system, you should be blocked away, locked away, blocked?",1900-01-01 01:42:03,yes beautifully put key process incentive evolution thing adapt effectively get incentive die thing social medium community unhealthy whatever want define incentive really like dying one thing people really get aggressive protest aggressively censored especially america know know much rest world idea freedom speech idea censorship really painful america yeah think grown east germany think censorship important tool brain intelligence social network basically good member entirety system blocked away locked away blocked,1
416,Guest," An important thing is, who decides that you are a good member?",1900-01-01 01:43:12,important thing decides good member,0
417,Lex Fridman, who... Is it distributed or... ?,1900-01-01 01:43:15,distributed,1
418,Guest," And what is the outcome of the process that decides it? Both for the individual and for society at large. For instance, if you have a high trust society, you don't need a lot of surveillance. And the surveillance is even in some sense undermining trust.",1900-01-01 01:43:17,outcome process decides individual society large instance high trust society need lot surveillance surveillance even sense undermining trust,0
419,Lex Fridman, Yeah.,1900-01-01 01:43:32,yeah,1
420,Guest, Because it's basically punishing people that look suspicious when surveyed but do the right thing anyway. And the opposite: if you have a low trust society and then surveillance can be a better trade off.,1900-01-01 01:43:32,basically punishing people look suspicious surveyed right thing anyway opposite low trust society surveillance better trade,0
421,Guest," And the US is currently making the transition from a relatively high-trust or mixed-trust society to a low-trust society. So surveillance will increase. Another thing is that beliefs are not just inert representations. They are implementations that run code on your brain and change your reality and change the way you interact with each other, at some level. And some of the beliefs are just public opinions that we used to display our alignment. So, for instance, people might say all cultures have... are the same and equally good. But still, they prefer to live in some cultures over others, very, very strongly so. And it turns out that their cultures are defined by certain rules of interaction, and these rules of interaction lead to different results when you implement them, right? So if you adhere to certain rules, you get different outcomes in different societies. And this all leads to very tricky situations when people do not have a commitment to a shared purpose. And our societies probably need to rediscover what it means to have a shared purpose and how to make this compatible with a non-totalitarian view. So in some sense, the US is caught in a conundrum between totalitarianism and diversity and doesn't [know] to how to resolve this and the solutions that the U.S. has found so far are very crude because it's a very young society that is also under a lot of tension.",1900-01-01 01:43:45,u currently making transition relatively high trust mixed trust society low trust society surveillance increase another thing belief inert representation implementation run code brain change reality change way interact level belief public opinion used display alignment instance people might say culture equally good still prefer live culture others strongly turn culture defined certain rule interaction rule interaction lead different result implement right adhere certain rule get different outcome different society lead tricky situation people commitment shared purpose society probably need rediscover mean shared purpose make compatible non totalitarian view sense u caught conundrum totalitarianism diversity know resolve solution u found far crude young society also lot tension,0

423,Lex Fridman," What do you think? Just the... Philosophising. What kind of mechanisms of government do you think we as a species should be evolving with, US or broadly, what do you think will work well? As a system. Of course, we don't know, it all seems to work pretty crappy, some things worse than others. Some people argue that communism is the best. Others say, yeah, look at the Soviet Union. Some people argue that anarchy is the best and then completely discarding the positive effects of government. You know, there's a lot of arguments. US seems to be doing pretty damn well in the span of history. There's respect for human rights, which seems to be a nice feature, not a bug. And economically, a lot of growth, a lot of technological development. People seem to be relatively kind on the grand scheme of things. Well, what lessons do you draw from that? What kind of government system do you think is good?",1900-01-01 01:45:08,think philosophising kind mechanism government think specie evolving u broadly think work well system course know seems work pretty crappy thing worse others people argue communism best others say yeah look soviet union people argue anarchy best completely discarding positive effect government know lot argument u seems pretty damn well span history respect human right seems nice feature bug economically lot growth lot technological development people seem relatively kind grand scheme thing well lesson draw kind government system think good,1
424,Guest," Ideally, governments should not be perceivable, right? It should be frictionless. The more you notice the influence of the government, the more friction you experience, the less effective and efficient the government probably is. Right? So a government, game theoretically, is an agent that imposes an offset on your payout metrics to make your Nash equilibrium compatible with the common good. Right? So you have these situations where people act on the local incentives and these local incentives, everybody does the thing that's locally the best for them. But the global outcome is not good. And this is even the case when people care about the global outcome because a regulation mechanism exists that creates a causal relationship between what I want to have for the global good and what I do. So, for instance, if I think that we should fly less and I stay at home, there's not a single plane that is going to not start because of me. Right? It's not going to have an influence, but I don't get from A to B. So the way to implement this would be to have a government that is sharing this idea that we should fly less and is then imposing a regulation that, for instance, makes flying more expensive and gives incentives for inventing other forms of transportation that are less... putting less strain on the environment, for instance.",1900-01-01 01:46:10,ideally government perceivable right frictionless notice influence government friction experience le effective efficient government probably right government game theoretically agent imposes offset payout metric make nash equilibrium compatible common good right situation people act local incentive local incentive everybody thing locally best global outcome good even case people care global outcome regulation mechanism exists creates causal relationship want global good instance think fly le stay home single plane going start right going influence get b way implement would government sharing idea fly le imposing regulation instance make flying expensive give incentive inventing form transportation le putting le strain environment instance,0

If you were unable to solve everything technologically, you can probably understand how high the child mortality needs to be to absorb the mutation rate and how high the mutation mutation rate needs to be to adapt to a slowly changing ecosystemic environment. Right? So you could in principle compute all these things game theoretically and adapt to it. But if you cannot do this because you are like me and you have children, you don't want them to die, you will use any kind of medical information to keep child mortality low, even if it means that our... within a few generations we have enormous genetic drift and most of us have allergies as a result of not being adapted because of the changes that we made to our food supply.",1900-01-01 01:48:02,make difficult unable solve everything technologically probably understand high child mortality need absorb mutation rate high mutation mutation rate need adapt slowly changing ecosystemic environment right could principle compute thing game theoretically adapt cannot like child want die use kind medical information keep child mortality low even mean within generation enormous genetic drift u allergy result adapted change made food supply,0

So basically major reboot of most complex organisms on Earth. And I think this is a possibility. I don't know if what the percentage for this possibility is, but it doesn't seem to be outlandish to me. If you look at the scale of the changes that we've already triggered on this planet and so Danny Hillis suggests that, for instance, we maybe able to put chalk into the stratosphere to limit solar radiation.

Basically, if your brain is wired up in such a way that you get rewards optimally in such an environment and there is some evidence for this that for a certain degree of complexity, basically people are more happy in such an environment because it's what you largely have evolved for. In between we had a few thousand years in which, I think, we have evolved for a slightly more comfortable environment. So there is probably something like an intermediate stage in which people would be more happy than they would be if they would have to fend for themselves in small groups in the forest and often die, versus something like this, where we now have basically a big machine, a big Mordor in which we run through concrete boxes and press buttons and machines and largely don't feel well cared for as the monkeys that we are.",1900-01-01 01:54:36,yes adapted basically brain wired way get reward optimally environment evidence certain degree complexity basically people happy environment largely evolved thousand year think evolved slightly comfortable environment probably something like intermediate stage people would happy would would fend small group forest often die versus something like basically big machine big mordor run concrete box press button machine largely feel well cared monkey,0

And what it is in its own nature and its own physics and so on. Right?

That's not is an open question whether you do or not. But my intuition is to be, to act in this world, there's a huge knowledge base that's underlying it, somehow. There's so much information of the kind we have never been able to construct in our... in neural networks and artificial intelligence systems, period. Which is like it's humbling, at least in my imagination. The amount of information required to act in this world humbles me.

510,Guest," Yes, so in some sense I think of the concepts as the addres- space for our behavior programs. And the behavior programs allow us to recognize objects and interact with them. Also mental objects. And large part of that is the physical world that we interact with, which is this Res Extenda thing, which is basically navigation of information and space. And basically it's similar to a game engine. It's a physics engine that you can use to describe and predict how things that look in a particular way, that feel when you touch them in a particular way, that of proprioception, that of auditory perception and so on, how they work out. So basically the geometry of all these things. And this is... Probably 80 percent of what our brain is doing is dealing with that, with this real time simulation. And by itself, a game engine is fascinating, but it's not that hard to understand what it's doing. Right? And our game engines are already, in some sense, approximating the fidelity of what we can perceive. So if we put on an Oculus Quest, we get something that is still relatively crude with respect to what we can perceive, but it's also in the same ballpark already, right? It's just a couple order of magnitude away from saturating our perception in terms of the complexity that it can produce. So in some sense, it's reasonable to say that our... the computer that you can buy and put into your home is able to give a perceptual reality that has the detail that is already in the same ballpark as what your brain can process. And everything else are ideas about the world. And I suspect that they are relatively sparse and also the intuitive models that we form about social interaction. Social interaction is is not so hard.

520,Lex Fridman, Yeah. So we have to remember that the brain is fundamentally interlinked with the body and our human and the biological system. Do you think that AGI systems that we try to create or greater intelligence systems would need to have a body? So...,1900-01-01 02:16:03,yeah remember brain fundamentally interlinked body human biological system think agi system try create greater intelligence system would need body,1
521,Guest," I think they should be able to make use of a body if you give it to them. But I don't think they fundamental need a body. So I suspect if you can interact with the world by moving your eyes and your head you can make controlled experiments. And this allows you to have many magnitudes fewer observations in order to reduce the uncertainty in your models, right? So you can pinpoint the errors in your models, but you're not quite sure and you just move your head and see what's what's going on over there and you get additional information. If you just have to use YouTube, as an input and you cannot do anything beyond this, you probably need just much more data. But if we have much more data. So if you can build a system that has enough time and attention to browse all of YouTube and extract all the information that there is to be found, I don't think there's an obvious limit to what it can do.",1900-01-01 02:16:15,think able make use body give think fundamental need body suspect interact world moving eye head make controlled experiment allows many magnitude fewer observation order reduce uncertainty model right pinpoint error model quite sure move head see going get additional information use youtube input cannot anything beyond probably need much data much data build system enough time attention browse youtube extract information found think obvious limit,0

And arguably, most people are not generally intelligent because they don't have to solve problems that make them generally intelligent. And even for us, it's not yet clear if we are smart enough build A.I. And understand our own nature to this degree, right? So it could be a matter of capacity. And for most people, it's in the first place, a matter of interest, they don't see the point. Because the benefit of attempting this project are marginal because you're probably not going to succeed in it. And the cost of trying to do it requires complete dedication of your entire life.

525,Lex Fridman," But it seems like the possibilities of what you can do in the virtual world ... so imagine that... is much greater than you can in the real world. So imagine a situation may be interesting option for me... If somebody came to me and offered, what I'll do...is...so from now on, you can only exist in the virtual world. And so you put on a headset and when you eat we'll make sure to connect your body up in a way that when you eat in the virtual world, your body will be nourished in the same way in the virtual world. So the aligning incentives between our common sort of real world and the virtual world, but then the possibilities become much bigger, like I could be other kinds of creatures, I could do... I can break the laws of physics as we know them. I could do a lot.. I mean, the possibilities are endless, right? That's as far as we think. It's an interesting thought whether, like what existence would be like, what kind of intelligence would emerge there, what kind of consciousness, what kind of maybe greater intelligence even mean me, Lex, even at this stage in my life, if I spend the next 20 years in the world to see how that intelligence emerges. And if I was... If that happened at the very beginning before I was even cognizant of my existence in this physical world, it's interesting to think how that child would develop and the way virtual reality and digitization of everything is moving. It's not completely out of the realm of possibility that we're all that some part of our lives will be, if not entirety of it, will live in a virtual world to a greater degree than we currently have living on Twitter and social media and so on.

526,Guest, I think that currently it's a waste of time to deal with the physical world before we have mechanisms that can automatically learn how to deal with it.

But the first feedback that you get is from this first order thing already. Basically, you decide to think a thought and the thought is being thought.

534,Guest," Yes, but the thing that you also put... mentioned just now is physics, that you could change in any way you want. So you need an environment that puts up resistance against you. If you if there's nothing to control, you cannot make models. Right? There needs to be a particular way that resists you. And by the way, your motivation is usually outside of your mind. It resists you. Motivation is what gets you up in the morning, even though it would be much less work to stay in bed. Right, so it's basically forcing you to resist the environment and it forces your mind to serve it, to serve this resistance to the environment. So in some sense, it is also putting up resistance against the natural tendency of the mind to not do anything.",1900-01-01 02:21:34,yes thing also put mentioned physic could change way want need environment put resistance nothing control cannot make model right need particular way resists way motivation usually outside mind resists motivation get morning even though would much le work stay bed right basically forcing resist environment force mind serve serve resistance environment sense also putting resistance natural tendency mind anything,0

We can already interface with other people by observing them very, very closely and getting in some kind of empathetic resonance.

There is an evolution going on, and so what we discover is that maybe the problem of government doesn't have stable solutions for us as a species because we are not designed in such a way that we can make everybody conform to them. So but there could be solutions that work under given circumstances or that are the best for certain environment and depends on, for instance, the primary forms of ownership and the means of production.

563,Guest," That was our form of governance. Right? At the same time, the Catholic Church implemented game theoretic principles. I recently reread Thomas Aquinas. It's very interesting to see this, because he was not dualist. He was translating Aristotle in a particular way for designing an operating system for the Catholic society. And he says that basically people are animals and very much the same way as Aristotle envisions, which basically organism with cybernetic control. And then he says that there are additional rational principles that humans can discover and everybody can discover them so there are universal. If you are sane you, should understand, you said to submit to them because you can rationally deduce them. And these principles are roughly: you should be willing to self-regulate correctly. You should be willing to do correct social regulation, inter-organismic. You should be willing to act on your models so you have skin in the game. And you should have goal rationality, you should be choosing the right goals to work on. And so basically these three rational principles, goal rationality he calls prudence or wisdom, social regulation is justice, the correct social one, and the internal regulation is temperance. And this thing, willingness to act on your models is courage. Mm hmm. And then he says that there are additionally to these four cardinal virtues, three divine virtues. And these three divine virtues cannot be rationally deduced but they reveal themselves by the harmony, which means if you assume them and you extrapolate what's going to happen, you will see that that makes sense. And it's often been misunderstood, as God has to tell you that these are the things. So they're basically there's something nefarious going on. The Christian conspiracy forces you to believe some guy with a long beard that they discovered this. But, uh, so these principles are relatively simple. Again, you need... its for high level organization, for the resulting civilization that you form, a commitment to unity, so basically you serve this higher, larger thing, this structural principle on the next level. And he calls that faith. Then there needs to be a commitment to a shared purpose. Basically this global reward that you try to figure out what that should be and how you can facilitate this and this is love. The commitment to a shared purpose is the core of love. Right. You see the sacred thing that is more important than your own organismic interests in the other. And you serve this together and this is how you see the sacred and the other. And the last one is hope, which means you need to be willing to act on that principle without getting rewards in the here and now because it doesn't exist yet. Then you start out building the civilization. Right. So you need to be able to do this in the absence of its actual existence yet so it can come into being.",1900-01-01 02:29:31,form governance right time catholic church implemented game theoretic principle recently reread thomas aquinas interesting see dualist translating aristotle particular way designing operating system catholic society say basically people animal much way aristotle envisions basically organism cybernetic control say additional rational principle human discover everybody discover universal sane understand said submit rationally deduce principle roughly willing self regulate correctly willing correct social regulation inter organismic willing act model skin game goal rationality choosing right goal work basically three rational principle goal rationality call prudence wisdom social regulation justice correct social one internal regulation temperance thing willingness act model courage mm hmm say additionally four cardinal virtue three divine virtue three divine virtue cannot rationally deduced reveal harmony mean assume extrapolate going happen see make sense often misunderstood god tell thing basically something nefarious going christian conspiracy force believe guy long beard discovered uh principle relatively simple need high level organization resulting civilization form commitment unity basically serve higher larger thing structural principle next level call faith need commitment shared purpose basically global reward try figure facilitate love commitment shared purpose core love right see sacred thing important organismic interest serve together see sacred last one hope mean need willing act principle without getting reward exist yet start building civilization right need able absence actual existence yet come,0

567,Guest," We got there via the question, what's the optimal form of governance? So I don't think that catholicism is the optimal form of governance because it's obviously on the way out. Right? So it is for the present type of society that we are in, religious institutions don't seem to be optimal to organize us. So what we discovered right now that we live in in the West is democracy. And democracy is the rule of oligarchs that are the people that currently own the means of production, that is administered not by the oligarchs themselves, because they there's too much disruption. Right. There's so much innovation that we have in every generation new means of production that we invent. And corporations die usually after 30 years or so. And something other takes a leading role in our societies. So it's administered by institutions. And these institutions themselves are not elected, but they provide continuity and they are led by electable politicians. And this makes it possible that you can adapt to change without having to kill people. Right. So you can tell, for instance, of a change in government if people think that the current government is too corrupt or is not up to date, you can just elect new people. Or if a journalist finds out something inconvenient about the institution and the institution is... has no plan B like in Russia, the journalist has to die. This is what... when you run a society by the deep state. So ideally you have an administration layer that you can change, if something bad happens. Right. So you will have a continuity in the whole thing. And this is the system that we came up in in the West. And the way it's set up in the US is largely a result of low level models. It's mostly just second third order consequences that people are modeling and the design of these institutions. It's a relatively young society that doesn't really take care of the downstream effects of many of the decisions that are being made. And I suspect that AI can help with this in a way, if you can fix the incentives. The society of the US, is as a society of cheaters.

577,Guest," I suspect that we can find a way back to AI by thinking about the way in which our brain has to organize itself. In some sense, our brain is a society of neurons and our mind is a society of behaviors. And they need to be organizing themselves into a structure that implements regulation. And government is social regulation. We often see government as the manifestation of power or local interests, but it's actually a platform for negotiating the conditions of human survival. And this platform emerges over the current needs and possibilities and the trajectory that we have. So given the present state, there are only so many options on how we can move into the next stage without completely disrupting everything. And we mostly agree that it's a bad idea to disrupt everything because it will endanger our food supply for a while and the entire infrastructure and fabric of society.

So speaking of revolutions and the connection between government systems in the mind, you also said that... you said that in some sense, becoming an adult means you take charge of your emotions.

582,Guest," I think that emotion is a configuration of the cognitive system. And that's especially true for the lowest level for the affective state. So when you have an affect, it's the configuration of certain modulation parameters like arousal, valence, your attentional focus, whether it's wide or narrow, intera-reception or extra-reception, and so on. And all these parameters together put you in a certain way that you relate with the environment and to yourself, and this is in some sense an emotional configuration.",1900-01-01 02:38:06,think emotion configuration cognitive system especially true lowest level affective state affect configuration certain modulation parameter like arousal valence attentional focus whether wide narrow intera reception extra reception parameter together put certain way relate environment sense emotional configuration,0
583,Guest," And the more narrow sense an emotion is an affective state that has an object. And the relevance of that object is given by motivation. And motivation is a bunch of needs that are associated with rewards, things that give you pleasure and pain. And you don't actually act on your needs, you act on models of your needs. Because when the pleasure and pain manifest, it's too late, you've done everything. So you act on expectations [of] what will give you a pleasure and pain. And these are your purposes. The needs don't form a hierarchy. They just coexist and compete. And your organism has... your brain has to find a dynamic homeostasis between them. But the purposes need to be consistent. So you basically can create a story for your life and make plans. And so we organize them all into hierarchies. And there is not a unique solution for this. Some people eat to make art and other people make art to eat. They might end up doing the same things, but they cooperate in very different ways because the ultimate goals are different and we cooperate based on shared purpose. Everything else that is not cooperation on shared purpose is transactional.",1900-01-01 02:38:33,narrow sense emotion affective state object relevance object given motivation motivation bunch need associated reward thing give pleasure pain actually act need act model need pleasure pain manifest late done everything act expectation give pleasure pain purpose need form hierarchy coexist compete organism brain find dynamic homeostasis purpose need consistent basically create story life make plan organize hierarchy unique solution people eat make art people make art eat might end thing cooperate different way ultimate goal different cooperate based shared purpose everything else cooperation shared purpose transactional,0

Are you distinguishing between the experience of emotion and the expression of emotion?,1900-01-01 02:39:35,think understood last piece achieving homeostasis distinguishing experience emotion expression emotion,1
585,Guest," Of course. So the experience of emotion is a feeling. And in this sense, what you feel is an appraisal that your perceptual system has made of the situation at hand. And it makes this based on your motivation. and on your estimates, not your but of the subconscious geometric parts of your mind that assess the situation in the world with something like a neural network. And this neural network is making itself known to the symbolic parts of your mind, to your conscious attention via mapping them as features into a space.",1900-01-01 02:39:47,course experience emotion feeling sense feel appraisal perceptual system made situation hand make based motivation estimate subconscious geometric part mind ass situation world something like neural network neural network making known symbolic part mind conscious attention via mapping feature space,0
586,Guest," So what you will feel about your emotion is a projection usually into your body map. So you might feel anxiety in your solar plexus and you might feel it as a contraction, which is all geometry. Right. Your body map is the space that is always instantiated and always available. So it's a very obvious cheat, if your non-symbolic parts of your brain, try to talk to your symbolic parts of your brain to map the feelings into the body map. And then you perceive them as pleasant or unpleasant, depending on whether the appraisal has a negative or positive valence. And then you have different features of them that give you more knowledge about the nature of what your feelings are. For instance, when you feel connected to other people, you typically feel this in your chest region around your heart, and you feel this is an expansive feeling in which you're reaching out. Right. And it's very intuitive to encode it like this. That's why it's encoded like this for most people.",1900-01-01 02:40:21,feel emotion projection usually body map might feel anxiety solar plexus might feel contraction geometry right body map space always instantiated always available obvious cheat non symbolic part brain try talk symbolic part brain map feeling body map perceive pleasant unpleasant depending whether appraisal negative positive valence different feature give knowledge nature feeling instance feel connected people typically feel chest region around heart feel expansive feeling reaching right intuitive encode like encoded like people,0

590,Guest," I suspect this probably evolved as part of an adversarial communication. So as soon as you started to observe the facial expression and posture of others to understand what emotional state they are in, others started to use this as signaling and also to subvert your model of their emotional state. So we now look at the inflections that the difference between the standard face that they're going to make in this situation. Like when you were at a funeral, everybody expects you to make a solemn face, but the solemn face doesn't express whether your sad or not. It just expresses that you understand what face you have to make at a funeral. Nobody should know that you are triumphant. So when you try to read the emotion of another person, you try to look at the delta between a sad, a truly sad expression and the things that are animated making this face behind the curtain.",1900-01-01 02:41:27,suspect probably evolved part adversarial communication soon started observe facial expression posture others understand emotional state others started use signaling also subvert model emotional state look inflection difference standard face going make situation like funeral everybody expects make solemn face solemn face express whether sad express understand face make funeral nobody know triumphant try read emotion another person try look delta sad truly sad expression thing animated making face behind curtain,0

They can release the neurotransmitters at will, if they train. And then the crisis of meaning pops up at a deeper layer. And the question is, why do I live?

And cells can cooperate if they can rely on other cells having a similar organization that is already compatible. But unless that's there, the cell needs to divide to create that structure by itself. Right. So it's a self organizing principle that works on a somewhat chaotic environment. And the purpose of life, in this sense, is to produce complexity. And the complexity allows you to harvest entropy gradients that you couldn't harvest without the complexity.

638,Guest," Lets consider something really wild. Imagine: is it possible that a gas giant could become intelligent? What would that involve? So imagine that you have vortices that spontaneously emerge on the gas giants, like big storm systems that endure for thousands of years. And some of these storm systems produce electromagnetic fields because some of the clouds are ferromagnetic or something. And as a result, they can change how certain clouds react rather than other clouds, and thereby produce some self stabilising patterns that eventually lead to regulation, feedback loops, nested feedback loops and control.",1900-01-01 02:54:23,let consider something really wild imagine possible gas giant could become intelligent would involve imagine vortex spontaneously emerge gas giant like big storm system endure thousand year storm system produce electromagnetic field cloud ferromagnetic something result change certain cloud react rather cloud thereby produce self stabilising pattern eventually lead regulation feedback loop nested feedback loop control,0

And at some point this wakes up and realizes and basically Lems' Solaris: I am a thinking planet. But I will not replicate because I cannot recreate the conditions of my own existence somewhere else. I'm just basically an intelligence that has spontaneously formed because it could. And now it builds Von Neumann probe. And the best Von Neumann probe for such a thing might be the cell. So maybe it will because it's very, very clever and very enduring, create cells and sends them out and one of them has infected our planet. I'm not suggesting that is the case, but it would be compatible with the panspermia hypothesis. And with my intuition that abiogenesis is very unlikely.

You construct the plants and the animals and you give everything their names and so on. That's basic cognitive development. It's a sequence of steps that every mind has to go through when it makes sense of the world. And when you have children you can see how initially they distinguish light and darkness. And then they make out directions in it, and they discover sky and ground, and they discover the plants and the animals, and they give everything their name.

Was undereducated or completely unaware about some major things that happened in the past or major ideas out there. I bring all that up to say that if we are to have difficult conversations, we have to give each other space to make mistakes, to learn, to grow.

12,Lex Fridman," You've mentioned that in your lab at Stanford, you induce stress by putting people into a virtual reality and having them go through one of a set of experiences.

13,Guest," So it depends on the person, obviously. And we should probably define fear, right, because you can, without going too far down the rabbit hole of defining these things, you know, you can't really have fear without stress, but you could have stress without fear. And you can't really have trauma without fear and stress. But you could have fear and stress without trauma. So, you know, we can start playing the word game. And that actually is one of the motivations for even having a laboratory that studies these things is that we really need better physiological, neuroscientific and operational definitions of what these things are.",2021-06-05 00:06:54,depends person obviously probably define fear right without going far rabbit hole defining thing know really fear without stress could stress without fear really trauma without fear stress could fear stress without trauma know start playing word game actually one motivation even laboratory study thing really need better physiological neuroscientific operational definition thing,0

So, increases in heart rate, increases and breathing, perspiration, pupil dilation, all the hallmark signature features of the stress response. And in some cases, we have the benefit of getting neurosurgery patients, where we've got electrodes in their amygdala and their insula and the orbital frontal cortex down beneath the skull.

But you feel as if you're following, excuse me because of the optic flow, that one is universal. So, we've got a dive with great white sharks experience where you actually exit the cage.

So when we decided to set up this platform, a lot of the motivation was that a lot of the studies of these things in laboratories, I don't want to call them lame, because I want to be respectful of the people that did the stuff before. But they study fear by, you know, showing subjects a picture of a bloody arm or a snake or something like that.

20,Guest," So we need to do something where people aren't going to get injured, but where we can tap into the physiology and that thing of presence of people momentarily, not the whole time, but momentarily forgetting they are in a laboratory. And so heights will always do it. And I if people want to challenge me on this, I like to point to that movie free solo, which was wild because, you know, it's incredible movie. But I think a lot of its popularity can be explained by a puzzle, which is, you knew he was going to live when you walked in the theater or you watched it at home. You knew before that he he survived.

21,Guest," So heights always does it. If we get people who have generalized anxiety, these are people who wake up and move through life at a generally higher state of autonomic arousal and anxiety, then we can tip them a little bit more easily with things that don't necessarily get everyone afraid, things like claustrophobia, public speaking, That's going to vary from person to person.",2021-06-05 00:10:32,height always get people generalized anxiety people wake move life generally higher state autonomic arousal anxiety tip little bit easily thing necessarily get everyone afraid thing like claustrophobia public speaking going vary person person,0

26,Guest," Yeah, maybe I should describe a little bit of the experiment. So without giving away too much in case someone wants to be a subject in one of these experiments. We have them playing a cognitive game. It's a simple lights out kind of game where you're pointing a cursor and turning out lights on a grid. But, it gets increasingly complex and it speeds up on them. And, you know, there's a failure point for everybody where they just can't make the motor commands fast enough.And then we surprise people essentially by placing them virtually, all of a sudden, they're there on a narrow platform between two buildings. And then we encourage them, or we cue them, with a talking to them through microphone, to continue across that platform to continue the game. And, you know, some people, they they just won't, they actually will get down on the ground and hold on to a virtual beam that doesn't even exist on a flat floor.",2021-06-05 00:11:26,yeah maybe describe little bit experiment without giving away much case someone want subject one experiment playing cognitive game simple light kind game pointing cursor turning light grid get increasingly complex speed know failure point everybody make motor command fast enough surprise people essentially placing virtually sudden narrow platform two building encourage cue talking microphone continue across platform continue game know people actually get ground hold virtual beam even exist flat floor,0
27,Guest," And so what this really tells us is the power of the brain to enter these virtual states as if they were real.

28,Guest," So, the reason we did a 360 video is, when we started all this back in twenty sixteen, a lot of the VR was pretty lame. Frankly, it was CGI. It just wasn't real enough. But with 360 video, we knew that we could get people into this presence where they think they're in a real experience more quickly.

It was there were some interesting moments out there of danger. But, he came back with that video and built that for the sharks. And then we realized we need to do this for everything. We need to do it for heights.

But if I turn back toward you, then it would it would be silent. So and that brings a very real element to one's own behavior where you don't know what's going to happen if you turn a corner.",2021-06-05 00:13:35,sound would instance turn around like giant attack dog moment would turn around see dog would growl turn back toward would would silent brings real element one behavior know going happen turn corner,0
31,Guest," Whereas if there's a dog growling behind me and I'm and I turn around and then I turn back to you and it's still growling. Yeah. That might seem like more of an impending threat, but unsustained threat. But actually, it's when you start linking your own body movements to the experience. So when it's closed loop, where my movements and choices are starting to influence things and they're getting scarier and scarier, that's when you can really drive people's nervous system down these paths of high, high states of stress and fear.",2021-06-05 00:13:56,whereas dog growling behind turn around turn back still growling yeah might seem like impending threat unsustained threat actually start linking body movement experience closed loop movement choice starting influence thing getting scarier scarier really drive people nervous system path high high state stress fear,0

33,Lex Fridman," Heights [laughs]. Yeah, well, from a psychology from neuroscience perspective, this whole construction that you've developed is fascinating. We did this a little bit with autonomous vehicles. So to try to understand the decision making process of a pedestrian when they cross the road and trying to create an experience of a car, you know, that can run you over. So there's a danger there. I was so surprised how real that whole world was. And the graphics that we built wasn't ultra realistic or anything, but I was still afraid of being hit by a car. Everybody we tested were really afraid of being hit by that car, even though it was all a simulation.",2021-06-05 00:14:34,height laugh yeah well psychology neuroscience perspective whole construction developed fascinating little bit autonomous vehicle try understand decision making process pedestrian cross road trying create experience car know run danger surprised real whole world graphic built ultra realistic anything still afraid hit car everybody tested really afraid hit car even though simulation,1

37,Guest," And incidentally, the way Mullard and, you know, folks learn how to not get eaten by great white sharks when you're swimming outside the cage is as they start lumbering in, you swim toward them and they get very confused when you luman them because clearly you're smaller. Clearly, they could eat you if they wanted to. But there's something about forward movement toward any creature, that that creature questions whether or not it would be a good idea to generate forward movement toward you. And so that's actually the survival tool of these cage exit white shark divers.",2021-06-05 00:15:46,incidentally way mullard know folk learn get eaten great white shark swimming outside cage start lumbering swim toward get confused luman clearly smaller clearly could eat wanted something forward movement toward creature creature question whether would good idea generate forward movement toward actually survival tool cage exit white shark diver,0
38,Lex Fridman," Are you playing around with like one of the critical things for the autonomous vehicle research is you couldn't do 360 video because the there's a game theoretic, there's an interactive element that's really necessary. So maybe people realizes, maybe they don't. But 360 video, you obviously what's actually not that obvious to people, but you can't change the reality that you're watching.",2021-06-05 00:16:21,playing around like one critical thing autonomous vehicle research video game theoretic interactive element really necessary maybe people realizes maybe video obviously actually obvious people change reality watching,1

40,Lex Fridman, So but you find that that's like is there something fundamental about fear and stress that the interactive element is essential for or do you find you can you can arouse people with just the video?,2021-06-05 00:16:45,find like something fundamental fear stress interactive element essential find arouse people video,1
41,Guest," Great question. It works best to use mixed reality. So we have a snake stimulus. I personally don't like snakes at all. I don't mind spiders. We also have spiders stimulus, but like snakes, I just don't like them. There's something about the the slithering and the it just it creates a visceral response for me. Some people not so much, and they have lower levels of stress and fear in there. But one way that we can get them to feel more of that is to use mixed reality where we have an actual physical bat and they have to stomp out the snake as opposed to just walk to a little safe corner, which then makes the snake disappear. That tends to be not as stressful as if they have a physical weapon. And so you've got people in there, you know, banging on the floor against this thing. And there's something about engaging that makes it more of a more of a threat.",2021-06-05 00:17:00,great question work best use mixed reality snake stimulus personally like snake mind spider also spider stimulus like snake like something slithering creates visceral response people much lower level stress fear one way get feel use mixed reality actual physical bat stomp snake opposed walk little safe corner make snake disappear tends stressful physical weapon got people know banging floor thing something engaging make threat,0
42,Guest," Now, I should also mention we we always get the subjective report from the subject of what they experience because we never want to project our own ideas about what they were feeling.

43,Lex Fridman, Exactly,2021-06-05 00:18:04,exactly,1
44,Guest," And humans aren't great at explaining how they feel.But, it's a lot easier to understand what they're saying than a mouse or a macaque monkey is saying.

45,Lex Fridman," Is there something you've learned about yourself, about your deepest fears? Like you said snakes? Is something that like if I were to torture you. So, I am Russian, so, you know, I always kind of think, how can I murder this people, that this person enter the room, but also how can I torture you to get some information out of you? Well, where would I go with?",2021-06-05 00:18:20,something learned deepest fear like said snake something like torture russian know always kind think murder people person enter room also torture get information well would go,1
46,Guest," Hmm. It's interesting you should say that. I never considered myself claustrophobic. But, because I don't mind small environments provided they're well ventilated. But. I, before covid, I started going to this Russian Albania, you know, they jump at you and I had never been to Albania. So, you know, the whole experience of really, really hot sauna and what do they call it? The plots. So they're hitting you with the leaves and. yeah, and it gets really hot and humid in there. And there were a couple of times where I thought, OK, this thing is below ground. It's in a city where there are a lot of earthquakes, like if this place crumbled and we were stuck in here and I'd start getting a little panicky and I realized I'm like, I don't like small confined spaces with poor ventilation.",2021-06-05 00:18:42,hmm interesting say never considered claustrophobic mind small environment provided well ventilated covid started going russian albania know jump never albania know whole experience really really hot sauna call plot hitting leaf yeah get really hot humid couple time thought ok thing ground city lot earthquake like place crumbled stuck start getting little panicky realized like like small confined space poor ventilation,0
47,Guest," So I realize I think I have some claustrophobia and I wasn't aware of that before. So I put myself into our own claustrophobia stimulus, which involves getting into an elevator and with a bunch of people, virtual people, and the elevator gets stalled. And at first you're fine, you feel fine. But then as we start modulating the environment and we actually can control levels of oxygen in the environment if we want to, it is really uncomfortable for me.",2021-06-05 00:19:28,realize think claustrophobia aware put claustrophobia stimulus involves getting elevator bunch people virtual people elevator get stalled first fine feel fine start modulating environment actually control level oxygen environment want really uncomfortable,0

50,Guest, Did you jump out?,2021-06-05 00:20:17,jump,0
51,Lex Fridman," Yeah. Yeah, jumped out. But it was it was a fundamentally different experience. And I guess that could be a lot of different flavors of fear of heights, maybe. But the one I have didn't seem to be connected to jumping out of a plane. Because its very different because like once you accept it, that you're going to jump, then it's it's a different thing. I think what I'm afraid of is the moments before it, it is the scariest part.",2021-06-05 00:20:18,yeah yeah jumped fundamentally different experience guess could lot different flavor fear height maybe one seem connected jumping plane different like accept going jump different thing think afraid moment scariest part,1

53,Lex Fridman," And, And I don't think that's emphasized in the skydiving experience as much and also just the acceptance of the fact that it's going to happen. So, once you accept that it's going to happen, it's not as scary. Its the fact that it's not supposed to happen and it might. That's the scary part. That, I guess I'm not being eloquent in this description, but there's something about skydiving that was actually philosophically liberating. I was I was like, wow, it was the possibility that you can walk on a surface and then at a certain point, there's no surface anymore to walk on. And it's all sudden the world becomes three dimensional.",2021-06-05 00:20:50,think emphasized skydiving experience much also acceptance fact going happen accept going happen scary fact supposed happen might scary part guess eloquent description something skydiving actually philosophically liberating like wow possibility walk surface certain point surface anymore walk sudden world becomes three dimensional,1

57,Guest," Yes. And that comes from two, from a, you know, research study standpoint. Two parallel tracks of research. One was done actually in mice because we have a mouse lab also where we can probe brown different brain areas and try and figure out what interesting brain areas we might want to probe around in humans .",2021-06-05 00:21:55,yes come two know research study standpoint two parallel track research one done actually mouse mouse lab also probe brown different brain area try figure interesting brain area might want probe around human,0
58,Guest," And graduate student in my lab. She's now at Caltech. Lindsay Salay, published a paper, back in twenty eighteen, showing that, what at first might seem a little bit obvious, but the mechanisms are not. Which is that there are really three responses to fear. You can pause, you can freeze essentially. You can retreat, you can back up or you can go forward. And there's a single hub of neurons in the midbrain, just actually not the midbrain, but it's in the middle of the thalamus, which is a forebrain structure. And depending on which neurons are active there, there's a much higher probability that a mouse or it turns out or a human will advance in the face of fear or will pause or will retreat.",2021-06-05 00:22:12,graduate student lab caltech lindsay salay published paper back twenty eighteen showing first might seem little bit obvious mechanism really three response fear pause freeze essentially retreat back go forward single hub neuron midbrain actually midbrain middle thalamus forebrain structure depending neuron active much higher probability mouse turn human advance face fear pause retreat,0
59,Guest," Now, that just assigns a neural structure to a behavioral phenomenon. But what's interesting is that it turns out that the lowest level of stress or autonomic arousal is actually associated with the pausing and freezing response. Then as the death threat becomes more impending and we used visual looms in this case, the retreat response has a slightly higher level of autonomic arousal and stress.",2021-06-05 00:22:57,assigns neural structure behavioral phenomenon interesting turn lowest level stress autonomic arousal actually associated pausing freezing response death threat becomes impending used visual loom case retreat response slightly higher level autonomic arousal stress,0
60,Guest," So think about playing hide and go seek. You're trying to stay quiet in a in a closet that you're hiding. If you're very calm, it's easy to stay quiet and still. As your level of stress goes up, it's harder to maintain that level of quiet and stillness. You see this also in animals that are stalking. A cat will chatter its teeth. That's actually sort of top down inhibition and trying to restrain behavior. So the freeze response is actually an active response, but it's fairly low stress.",2021-06-05 00:23:23,think playing hide go seek trying stay quiet closet hiding calm easy stay quiet still level stress go harder maintain level quiet stillness see also animal stalking cat chatter teeth actually sort top inhibition trying restrain behavior freeze response actually active response fairly low stress,0
61,Guest, And what was interesting to us is that the highest level of autonomic arousal was associated with the forward movement toward the threat.,2021-06-05 00:23:51,interesting u highest level autonomic arousal associated forward movement toward threat,0
62,Guest," So in your case, jumping out of the plane. However, the forward movement in the face of threat was linked to the activation of what we call collateral, which means just a side connection, literally a wire in the brain that connects to the dopamine circuits for reward.",2021-06-05 00:23:59,case jumping plane however forward movement face threat linked activation call collateral mean side connection literally wire brain connects dopamine circuit reward,0
63,Guest," And so when one safely and adaptively, meaning you survive, moves through a threat or toward a threat, it's rewarded as a positive experience. And so the key, it actually maps very well to the cognitive behavioral therapy and a lot of the existing treatments for trauma, is that you have to confront the thing that makes you afraid. So, otherwise you exist in this very low level of reverbatory circuit activity, where the the circuits for autonomic arousal are humming and they're humming more and more and more.",2021-06-05 00:24:16,one safely adaptively meaning survive move threat toward threat rewarded positive experience key actually map well cognitive behavioral therapy lot existing treatment trauma confront thing make afraid otherwise exist low level reverbatory circuit activity circuit autonomic arousal humming humming,0
64,Guest," And we have to remember that that stress and fear and threat were designed to agitate us so that we actually move. Now. So the reason I mention this is I think a lot of times people think that the maximum, you know, stress response or fear response is to freeze and to lock up. But that's actually not the maximum stress response. Maximum stress response is to advance, but it's associated with reward. It has positive valence.",2021-06-05 00:24:49,remember stress fear threat designed agitate u actually move reason mention think lot time people think maximum know stress response fear response freeze lock actually maximum stress response maximum stress response advance associated reward positive valence,0
65,Guest," So, so there's this kind of everyone always thinks about the bell, you know, the sort of shape curve for, you know, at low levels of arousal, performance is low and as it increases performance goes higher and then it drops off as you get really stressed. But, there is another bump further out the distribution where you perform very well under very high levels of stress.",2021-06-05 00:25:14,kind everyone always think bell know sort shape curve know low level arousal performance low increase performance go higher drop get really stressed another bump distribution perform well high level stress,0
66,Guest," And so we've been spending a lot of time in humans and in animals exploring what it takes to get people comfortable to go to that place and also to let them experience how their heightened states of cognition there. There's changes in time perception that allow you to evaluate your environment, in fast, at a faster frame rate, essentially. This is the matrix. As a lot of people think of it.

69,Lex Fridman," And that's, like you said, the little bump that that seems to be a very small fraction of the human experience. Right. So it's kind of fascinating to study it because most of us move through life without ever experiencing in that kind of focus",2021-06-05 00:26:25,like said little bump seems small fraction human experience right kind fascinating study u move life without ever experiencing kind focus,1

What's optimal performance?",2021-06-05 00:26:48,many interesting word performance optimal performance talking mental ability perceive environment quickly make action quickly optimal performance,1
72,Guest," Yeah, well, it's very subjective and it varies depending on task and environment. So, one way we can make it a little bit more operational and concrete is to say there is a sweet spot, if you will, where the level of internal autonomic arousal, aka stress or alertness, whatever you want to call it, is ideally matched to the speed of whatever challenge you have got to be facing in the outside world. So we all have perception of the outside world as exteroception and the perception of our internal real estate, interoception. And when those two things when interception and exterior perception are matched along a couple dimensions, performance tends to increase. It tends to be in an optimal range.",2021-06-05 00:27:04,yeah well subjective varies depending task environment one way make little bit operational concrete say sweet spot level internal autonomic arousal aka stress alertness whatever want call ideally matched speed whatever challenge got facing outside world perception outside world exteroception perception internal real estate interoception two thing interception exterior perception matched along couple dimension performance tends increase tends optimal range,0
73,Guest," So, for instance, if you're I don't play guitar, but I know you play guitar. So let's say you're trying to learn something new on the guitar. I'm not saying that being in these super high states of activation are the best place for you to be in order to learn. It may be that you your internal arousal needs to be at a level where your analysis of space and time has to be well matched to the information coming in. And what you're trying to do in terms of performance, in terms of playing chords and notes and so forth.",2021-06-05 00:27:53,instance play guitar know play guitar let say trying learn something new guitar saying super high state activation best place order learn may internal arousal need level analysis space time well matched information coming trying term performance term playing chord note forth,0
74,Guest," Now, in these cases of high threat where things are coming in quickly and animals and humans need to react very quickly, the higher your state of autonomic arousal, the better. Because you're slicing time more finely just because of the way the autonomic system works. It, you know, the the the pupil dilation, for instance, and movement of the lens essentially changes your your optics. And that's obvious. But, in, with the change in optics is a change in how you bend time and slice time, which allows you to get more frames per second, readout.",2021-06-05 00:28:23,case high threat thing coming quickly animal human need react quickly higher state autonomic arousal better slicing time finely way autonomic system work know pupil dilation instance movement lens essentially change optic obvious change optic change bend time slice time allows get frame per second readout,0
75,Guest," With the guitar learning, for instance, it might actually be that you want to be almost sleepy, almost in a kind of drowsy state to be able to. And I don't play music, so I can't I'm guessing here. But since some of the nuance in the chords or the ways that you're to be relaxed enough that your fingers can follow an external cue. So matching the movement of your fingers to something that's pure exteroception.",2021-06-05 00:28:54,guitar learning instance might actually want almost sleepy almost kind drowsy state able play music guessing since nuance chord way relaxed enough finger follow external cue matching movement finger something pure exteroception,0
76,Guest," And so there is no perfect autonomic state for performance. This is why I don't favor terms like flow, because they're not, well, operationally defined enough. But, I do believe that optimal or peak performance is going to arise when internal state is ideally matched to this base time features of the external demands.",2021-06-05 00:29:18,perfect autonomic state performance favor term like flow well operationally defined enough believe optimal peak performance going arise internal state ideally matched base time feature external demand,0
77,Lex Fridman," So there's some slicing of time that happens and then you're able to adjust slice time more finely or more or less finely in order to adjust to the the stimulus, the dynamics of the stimulus. What about the the realm of ideas? So, like, you know, I'm a big believer. This guy named Cal Newport wrote a book about Deep work.",2021-06-05 00:29:44,slicing time happens able adjust slice time finely le finely order adjust stimulus dynamic stimulus realm idea like know big believer guy named cal newport wrote book deep work,1

79,Lex Fridman," Yeah, he's great. He. I mean, one of the nice things I've always practiced, deep work. But, he, it's always nice to have words, put to the the concepts that you've practiced, it somehow makes them more concrete and allows you to to get better. It turns into a skill that you can get better at. But, you know, I also value deep thinking where you think, it's almost meditative. You think about a particular concept for long periods of time. The programming you have to do that kind of thing for yourself to hold this concept like like you hold it and then you take steps, will, you take further steps and you're holding relatively complicated things in your mind as you're thinking about them. And there's a lot of. I mean, the hardest part is there's frustrating things like you take a step and it turns out to be the wrong directions, you have to calmly turn around and take a step back. And then it's kind of like exploring the space of ideas. Is there something about your study of optimal performance that can be applied to the act of thinking as opposed to action?",2021-06-05 00:30:09,yeah great mean one nice thing always practiced deep work always nice word put concept practiced somehow make concrete allows get better turn skill get better know also value deep thinking think almost meditative think particular concept long period time programming kind thing hold concept like like hold take step take step holding relatively complicated thing mind thinking lot mean hardest part frustrating thing like take step turn wrong direction calmly turn around take step back kind like exploring space idea something study optimal performance applied act thinking opposed action,1
80,Guest," Well, we haven't done too much work there. But what but I think I can comment on it from a neuroscience, which is really all I do is, well, I mean, we do experiments in the lab, but looking at things through the lens of neuroscience. So what you're describing can be mapped fairly well to working memory, just keeping things online and updating them as they change and information is coming back into your brain. Jack Feldman, who I'm a huge fan of and fortunate to be friends with, is a professor at UCLA, works on respiration and breathing, but he has a physics background.",2021-06-05 00:31:23,well done much work think comment neuroscience really well mean experiment lab looking thing lens neuroscience describing mapped fairly well working memory keeping thing online updating change information coming back brain jack feldman huge fan fortunate friend professor ucla work respiration breathing physic background,0
81,Guest," And and so he thinks about respiration and breathing in terms of ground states and how they modulate other states. Very, very interesting and I think important work. Jack has an answer to your question. So I'm not going to get this exactly right because this is lifted from a coffee conversation that we had about a month ago. But so apologies in advance for that. But I think I can get mostly right. So, we were talking about this, about how the brain updates cognitive states, depending on demands and thinking in particular. And he used an interesting example. I'd be curious to know if you agree or disagree. He said, you know, most great mathematics is done by people in their late teens and 20s and even you could say early 20s, sometimes into the late 20s, but not much further on. Maybe I just insulted some mathematician. No, that's that's true. And I think that it demands his argument was there's a tremendous demand on working memory to work out theorems in math and to keep a number of plates spinning, so to speak, mentally, and run back and forth between them, updating them. In physics, Jack said, and I I think this makes sense to me, too, that there's a reliance on working memory, but an increased reliance on some sort of deep, deep memory and deep memory stores, probably stuff that's moved out of the hippocampus and forebrain and into the cortex and is more some episodic and declarative stuff. But really, so, you're pulling from your library. Basically, it's not all RAM. It's not all working memory. And then in biology, and physicists tend to have very active careers into their 30s and 40s and 50s and so forth, sometimes later. And that in biology, you see careers that have a much longer arc, kind of these protracted careers. Often people still in their 60s and 70s doing doing really terrific work. Not always doing it with their own hands because the people in the labs are doing them of course. But and that work does tend to rely on insights gained from having a very deep knowledge base where you can remember a paper and or maybe a figure in a paper. You could go look it up if you wanted to, but it's very different than the working memory of the mathematician. And so when you're talking about coding or being in that tunnel of thought and trying to iterate and keeping a lot of plate spinning, it, it speaks directly to working memory.",2021-06-05 00:32:00,think respiration breathing term ground state modulate state interesting think important work jack answer question going get exactly right lifted coffee conversation month ago apology advance think get mostly right talking brain update cognitive state depending demand thinking particular used interesting example curious know agree disagree said know great mathematics done people late teen even could say early sometimes late much maybe insulted mathematician true think demand argument tremendous demand working memory work theorem math keep number plate spinning speak mentally run back forth updating physic jack said think make sense reliance working memory increased reliance sort deep deep memory deep memory store probably stuff moved hippocampus forebrain cortex episodic declarative stuff really pulling library basically ram working memory biology physicist tend active career forth sometimes later biology see career much longer arc kind protracted career often people still really terrific work always hand people lab course work tend rely insight gained deep knowledge base remember paper maybe figure paper could go look wanted different working memory mathematician talking coding tunnel thought trying iterate keeping lot plate spinning speaks directly working memory,0
82,Guest," My lab hasn't done too much of that work in memory, but we are pushing working memory when we have people do things like these simple lights out tasks while they're under, we can increase the cognitive load by increasing the level of autonomic arousal to the point where they start doing less well. And, you know, everyone has a cliff. This is what's kind of fun. We've had, you know, SEAL team operators come to the lab.

84,Guest," So what you're describing is very interesting because I think it has to do with how narrow or broad the information set is. Because and I don't, I'm not an active programmer. So this is a regime I don't really fully know. So I don't want to comment about it, in the, in any way, that, you know, doesn't suggest that. But I think that what you're talking about is top down control. So this is prefrontal cortex keeping every bit of reflexive circuitry at bay, the one that makes you want to get up and use the restroom, the one that makes you want to check your phone, all of that, but also running these interior thalamus to prefrontal cortex loops, which we know are very important for working memory.",2021-06-05 00:35:15,describing interesting think narrow broad information set active programmer regime really fully know want comment way know suggest think talking top control prefrontal cortex keeping every bit reflexive circuitry bay one make want get use restroom one make want check phone also running interior thalamus prefrontal cortex loop know important working memory,0
85,Lex Fridman," And let me try to think that it's a little bit. So, reducing the process of thinking to working memory access is tricky. He's probably ultimately correct. But if I were to say some of the most challenging things that an engineer has to do and a scientific thinker, I would say it's kind of depressing to think that we do that best in our 20s. But, is this kind of first principles thinking step of of saying. You you're accessing the things that you know and then saying, well, let me how do I do this differently than I've done it before?",2021-06-05 00:35:57,let try think little bit reducing process thinking working memory access tricky probably ultimately correct say challenging thing engineer scientific thinker would say kind depressing think best kind first principle thinking step saying accessing thing know saying well let differently done,1
86,Lex Fridman," This this weird, like stepping back, like, is this right? Let's try this other way. That that's the most mentally taxing step is like you've gotten quite good at this particular pattern of how you solve this particular problem. So there's a there's a pattern recognition. First, you're like, OK, I know how to build a thing that solves this particular problem in programming, say. And then the question is. But can I do it much better? And I don't know if that's. I don't know what the hell that is. I don't know if that's accessing working memory, that's that's almost maybe it is accessing memory in a sense. It's trying to find similar patterns in a totally different place that could be projected onto this. But you're it's you're not querying facts.

87,Guest," Yes. Patterns. I mean, you're putting out your testing algorithms. Yeah. You're testing algorithms. So I want to just because I know of some of the people listening to this and you have or have basis in, you know, scientific training and have scientific training. So I want to be clear. I think we can be correct about some things like the role of working memory in these kinds of processes without being exhaustive. We're not saying that the only thing we're, you know, correct, but not assume that that's the only thing involved.",2021-06-05 00:37:43,yes pattern mean putting testing algorithm yeah testing algorithm want know people listening basis know scientific training scientific training want clear think correct thing like role working memory kind process without exhaustive saying thing know correct assume thing involved,0

89,Guest," And I mean, neuroscience, let's face it, is still in its infancy. I mean, we probably know one percent of what there is to know about the brain. You know, we've learned so much. And yet there may be global states that underlie this, that make prefrontal circuitry work differently than it would in it, in a different regime or even time of day. I mean, there's a lot of mysteries about this. But so I just want to make sure that we we sort of are we're aiming for precision and accuracy, but we're not going to be, we're not going to be exhaustive. So there's a difference there. And I think, you know, sometimes in the vastness of the Internet, that gets forgotten.",2021-06-05 00:38:13,mean neuroscience let face still infancy mean probably know one percent know brain know learned much yet may global state underlie make prefrontal circuitry work differently would different regime even time day mean lot mystery want make sure sort aiming precision accuracy going going exhaustive difference think know sometimes vastness internet get forgotten,0
90,Guest," So the other is that. You know, we think about how we think about these operations at, you know, really focused, keeping a lot of things online, but what you were describing is actually, it, it speaks to the very real possibility, probably that with certainty there's another element to all this, which is when you're trying out lots of things, in particular, lots of different algorithms, you don't want to be in a in a state of very high autonomic arousal. That's not what you want, because the higher level of autonomic arousal and stress in the system, the more rigidly you're going to analyze space and time and what you're talking about is playing with space time dimensionality. And I want to be very clear. You know, I'm the son of a physicist. I am not a physicist. When I talk about space and time, I'm literally talking about visual space and how long it takes for my finger to move from this point. to this point.",2021-06-05 00:38:50,know think think operation know really focused keeping lot thing online describing actually speaks real possibility probably certainty another element trying lot thing particular lot different algorithm want state high autonomic arousal want higher level autonomic arousal stress system rigidly going analyze space time talking playing space time dimensionality want clear know son physicist physicist talk space time literally talking visual space long take finger move point point,0

92,Guest," And that's primarily done by the visual system in humans. We don't walk through space, for instance, like a scent hound would and look at three dimensional scent plumes. You know, when a scent hound, goes out into the environment, they have depth to their odor, their odor trails. And they don't think about them. We don't think about odor trails. You might say, oh, well, the smell is getting more intense. Aha. But they actually have three dimensional odor trail. So there you see a cone of odour. A seed, of course, with their nose and their factory cortex.",2021-06-05 00:39:53,primarily done visual system human walk space instance like scent hound would look three dimensional scent plume know scent hound go environment depth odor odor trail think think odor trail might say oh well smell getting intense aha actually three dimensional odor trail see cone odour seed course nose factory cortex,0
93,Guest," We do that with our visual system and we parse time often subconsciously with mainly with our visual system, also with our auditory system. And this shows up for the musicians out there.

94,Guest," So in any event, space and time are linked in the through the sensory apparati, through the eyes and ears and nose, and probably through taste to and through touch for us, but mainly through vision. So, when you drop into some coding or iterating through a creative process or trying to solve something hard, you can't really do that well, if you're in a rigid, high level of autonomic arousal because you're plugging in algorithms that are in this space regime, this time regime matches that space time match.",2021-06-05 00:40:42,event space time linked sensory apparati eye ear nose probably taste touch u mainly vision drop coding iterating creative process trying solve something hard really well rigid high level autonomic arousal plugging algorithm space regime time regime match space time match,0
95,Guest," Whereas creativity, I always think the lava lamp is actually a pretty good example, even though it has these counterculture new agey connotations, because you actually don't know which direction things are going to change. And so in drowsy states, sleeping and drowsy states, space and time become dislodged from one another somewhat. And they're very fluid. And I think that's why a lot of solutions come to people after sleep and naps. And this could even take us into a discussion, if you like, about psychedelics.",2021-06-05 00:41:17,whereas creativity always think lava lamp actually pretty good example even though counterculture new agey connotation actually know direction thing going change drowsy state sleeping drowsy state space time become dislodged one another somewhat fluid think lot solution come people sleep nap could even take u discussion like psychedelics,0
96,Guest," And what we now know, for instance, that people thought that psychedelics work by just creating spontaneous bursting of neurons and hallucinations, but that the fivish, 2C and 2A receptors, which are the main sites for things like LSD and psilocybin and some of the other halluc..., the ones that create hallucinations, the drugs that create hallucinations.",2021-06-05 00:41:45,know instance people thought psychedelics work creating spontaneous bursting neuron hallucination fivish receptor main site thing like lsd psilocybin halluc one create hallucination drug create hallucination,0
97,Guest," The most of those receptors are actually in the collection of neurons that encase the thalamus, which is where all the sensory information goes into, a structure called the thalamic reticular nucleus. And it's an inhibitory structure that makes sure that when we're sitting here talking, that I'm mainly focused on whatever I'm seeing visually, that I'm essentially eliminating a lot of sensory information. Under conditions where people take psychedelics and these, particularly when serotonin receptors are activated. That inhibitory shell, it's literally shaped like a shell, starts losing its ability to inhibit the passage of sensory information. But mostly the effects of psychedelics are because of the lateral connectivity in layer five of cortex across cortical areas is increased.",2021-06-05 00:42:08,receptor actually collection neuron encase thalamus sensory information go structure called thalamic reticular nucleus inhibitory structure make sure sitting talking mainly focused whatever seeing visually essentially eliminating lot sensory information condition people take psychedelics particularly serotonin receptor activated inhibitory shell literally shaped like shell start losing ability inhibit passage sensory information mostly effect psychedelics lateral connectivity layer five cortex across cortical area increased,0
98,Guest," And what that does is that means that the space time relationship for vision, like moving my finger from here to here, very rigid space time relationship. Right. If I slow it down, it's slower, obviously, but there's a prediction that can be made based on the neurons in the retina, and the cortex. On psychedelics, this could be very strange experience, but the auditory system has one that's slightly different spacetime and they're matched to one another, deeper circuits in the brain. Your olefactory factory system has a different time relationship to it.",2021-06-05 00:42:59,mean space time relationship vision like moving finger rigid space time relationship right slow slower obviously prediction made based neuron retina cortex psychedelics could strange experience auditory system one slightly different spacetime matched one another deeper circuit brain olefactory factory system different time relationship,0
99,Guest," So. Under conditions of of these increased activation of the serotonin receptors, space and time across sensory area starts being fluid. So I'm no longer running the algorithm for moving my fingers from here to here and making a prediction based on vision alone. I'm now this is where people talk about hearing sites, right. Do you start linking the this might actually make a sound in a psychedelic state.",2021-06-05 00:43:26,condition increased activation serotonin receptor space time across sensory area start fluid longer running algorithm moving finger making prediction based vision alone people talk hearing site right start linking might actually make sound psychedelic state,0
100,Guest," Now, I'm not suggesting people run out and do psychedelics because it's very disorganized, but essentially what you're doing is you're mixing the algorithms. And so when you talk about being able to access new solutions, you don't need to rely on psychedelics. If people choose to do that, that's their business. But in drowsy states, this lateral connectivity is increased as well. The shell of the thalamus shuts down. And once, these are through these so-called Ponto-geniculo-occipital waves.",2021-06-05 00:43:54,suggesting people run psychedelics disorganized essentially mixing algorithm talk able access new solution need rely psychedelics people choose business drowsy state lateral connectivity increased well shell thalamus shuts called ponto geniculo occipital wave,0
101,Guest," And what's happening is you're getting whole brain activation at a level that you start mixing algorithms. And so sometimes I think solutions come not from being in that narrow tunnel of space time and strong activation of working memory and trying to iterate if this than this very strong deductive and inductive thinking and working from first principles, but also from states where something that was an algorithm that never you never had in existence before suddenly gets lumped with another algorithm and all of a sudden a new possibility comes to mind.",2021-06-05 00:44:19,happening getting whole brain activation level start mixing algorithm sometimes think solution come narrow tunnel space time strong activation working memory trying iterate strong deductive inductive thinking working first principle also state something algorithm never never existence suddenly get lumped another algorithm sudden new possibility come mind,0
102,Guest," And so space and time need to be fluid and space and time need to be rigid in order to come up with something meaningful. And I realize I'm riffing long on this, but this is why I think, you know, there was so much interest a few years ago with Michael Pollan's book and and other things happening about psychedelics as a pathway to exploration and all this kind of thing. But the real question is what you export back from those experiences, because dreams are amazing.

Hypnosis is something that my colleague David Spiegel, associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford, works on, where also, again, it's a unique state because you have narrow context.

Looking at these are mouse mutants where these are models for autism, where nothing is disrupted in the brain proper and in the central nervous system.

You've put yourself into a high limbic friction environment, meaning that the prefrontal cortex has to work really hard. But there's another side to limbic friction, too, which is when you're very sleepy, there's nothing incoming. It can be completely silent and it's hard to engage in focus because you're drifting off, you're getting sleepy. So their limbic friction is high, but for the opposite reason, autonomic arousal is too low.",2021-06-05 00:58:35,pure top control limbic friction high environment put high limbic friction environment meaning prefrontal cortex work really hard another side limbic friction sleepy nothing incoming completely silent hard engage focus drifting getting sleepy limbic friction high opposite reason autonomic arousal low,0

I guess one way you could envision it spatially, especially if people are listening to this, just an audio is I like to think about it kind of like a glass barbell where one sphere of perception and attention can be on what's going on with me and one sphere of attention can be given what's going on with you or something else in the room or in my environment.",2021-06-05 00:59:00,turning netflix background looping song might boost level alertness allow top control exactly sweet spot want earlier saying feel inside relative going outside constantly guess one way could envision spatially especially people listening audio like think kind like glass barbell one sphere perception attention going one sphere attention given going something else room environment,0

They're strongly modulated by levels of autonomic arousal, and that if we want to form the optimal relationship to some task or some pressure or something, whether or not it's sleep, an impending threat or coding, we need to adjust our internal space-time relationship with the external space-time relationship.",2021-06-05 01:01:08,excuse really three thing neuron either sensory neuron motor neuron modulating thing model attention perception tell u got interception extra perception strongly modulated level autonomic arousal want form optimal relationship task pressure something whether sleep impending threat coding need adjust internal space time relationship external space time relationship,0

289,Guest, There are some neurons that respond. They fire when the neurons move up. And then what they do is they start varying the coherence of that motion. So they made it so only 50 percent of the dots moved up and the rest moved randomly. And that neuron fires a little less. And eventually it's random in that neuron stops firing because it's just kind of dots moving everywhere. It's awesome.

You could Lesion empty animals lose the ability to do these kind of coherence, discrimination or direction discrimination. But the amazing experiment, the one that just.

329,Guest," But there it you know, there were books written about it. It makes for great television stuff and thought. Around the table or after a couple glasses of wine or whatever, it's an important problem nonetheless. And so I think I do think the consciousness the issue is it's not operationally defined. Right, that psychologists are much smarter than a lot of hard scientists in that for the following reason, they put operational definitions. They know that psychology, if we're talking about motivation, for instance, they know they need to put operational definitions on that so that two laboratories can know they're studying the same thing.",2021-06-05 01:51:15,know book written make great television stuff thought around table couple glass wine whatever important problem nonetheless think think consciousness issue operationally defined right psychologist much smarter lot hard scientist following reason put operational definition know psychology talking motivation instance know need put operational definition two laboratory know studying thing,0

It's like attention or or intelligence and artificial intelligence community.

It's the thing that creates the most limbic friction. And so if you can overcome that, then there's carry over.

412,Guest, What you're doing is you're exercising a circuit for Top-Down control. And that circuit was not designed to be for bear crawls or pull ups or coding or waking up in the middle of the night to do something hard. That circuit was designed to override limbic friction. And so neural circuits were designed to generalise. Right. The stress response to an incoming threat that's a physical threat was designed to feel the same way and be the same response internally as the threat to an impending exam or divorce or marriage or whatever it is that stressing somebody out.,2021-06-05 02:13:03,exercising circuit top control circuit designed bear crawl pull ups coding waking middle night something hard circuit designed override limbic friction neural circuit designed generalise right stress response incoming threat physical threat designed feel way response internally threat impending exam divorce marriage whatever stressing somebody,0
413,Guest," And so neural circuits are not designed to be for one particular action or purpose. So if you couldn't, as you did, if you can train up top down control under conditions of the highest limbic friction, that when the desire to quit is at its utmost, either because of fatigue or hyperarousal being too stressed or too tired, you're you're learning how to engage a circuit.

426,Guest," Ah, so there's a we can put something very concrete to that. There's a paper published in Cell, Super Top Tier Journal, two years ago looking at effort. And this was in a visual environment of trying to swim forward toward a target and a reward. And it was a really cool experiment because they manipulated virtually the visual environment. So the same amount of effort was being expended every time. But sometimes the perception was you're making forward progress and sometimes the perception was you're making no progress because stuff wasn't drifting by meant no progress.",2021-06-05 02:16:04,ah put something concrete paper published cell super top tier journal two year ago looking effort visual environment trying swim forward toward target reward really cool experiment manipulated virtually visual environment amount effort expended every time sometimes perception making forward progress sometimes perception making progress stuff drifting meant progress,0
427,Guest," So you could be swimming and swimming and making progress. And it turns out that with each bout of effort, there's an epinephrine and norepinephrine is being released in the brainstem and glia what traditionally were thought of as support cells for the neurons. But they do a lot of things actively, too, are measuring the amount of epinephrine and norepinephrine in that circuit. And when it exceeds a certain threshold, the Glia send inhibitory signals that shut down Top-Down control, they literally it's the quick stop.",2021-06-05 02:16:39,could swimming swimming making progress turn bout effort epinephrine norepinephrine released brainstem glia traditionally thought support cell neuron lot thing actively measuring amount epinephrine norepinephrine circuit exceeds certain threshold glia send inhibitory signal shut top control literally quick stop,0
428,Guest," There's no more. It's you quit enduring. It can be rescued. Endurance can be rescued with dopamine. Beat. So that's where the subjective part really comes into play. So you quit because you've learned how to turn that off or you've learned how to. Some people will reward the pain process so much that friction becomes the reward. And, you know, when you talk about people like Goggins and other people I know from Special Operations and people have gone through cancer treatments three times, you hear about, you know, just when you hear about people, the Victor Frankl stories, I mean, you hear about Nelson Mandela, you hear about these stories.",2021-06-05 02:17:10,quit enduring rescued endurance rescued dopamine beat subjective part really come play quit learned turn learned people reward pain process much friction becomes reward know talk people like goggins people know special operation people gone cancer treatment three time hear know hear people victor frankl story mean hear nelson mandela hear story,0
429,Guest," I'm sure the same processes involved. Again, this speaks to the generalizability of these processes as opposed to a neural circuit for a particular action or cognitive function. So, I think, you have to learn to subjectively self reward in a way that replenishes you. Goggins talks about eating souls. It's a very dramatic example in his mind. Apparently, that's a form of reward. But it's not just a form of reward where you're it's like you're picking up a trophy or something.",2021-06-05 02:17:52,sure process involved speaks generalizability process opposed neural circuit particular action cognitive function think learn subjectively self reward way replenishes goggins talk eating soul dramatic example mind apparently form reward form reward like picking trophy something,0

439,Guest," Well, I think the key is to dynamically control your output and that can be done by reducing effort, which doesn't work throughout, but also by restoring through these subjective reward processes. And we don't want to go down the rabbit hole of why this all works, but these are ancient pathways that were designed to bring resources to an animal or to a person through foraging for hunting or mates or water, all these things.

One of the great challenges in assigning a good you know, giving a good answer to the question of like, what's the meaning of life is, I think, illustrated best by the Victor Frankl example, although there are other examples, too, which is that our sense of meaning is very elastic in time and space.",2021-06-05 02:29:16,hmm one great challenge assigning good know giving good answer question like meaning life think illustrated best victor frankl example although example sense meaning elastic time space,0
470,Guest," And we talked a little bit about this earlier, but it's amazing to me that somebody locked in a cell or a concentration camp can bring the horizon in close enough that they can then micro slice their environment so that they can find rewards and meaning and power and beauty even in a little square box or or a horrible situation.",2021-06-05 02:29:38,talked little bit earlier amazing somebody locked cell concentration camp bring horizon close enough micro slice environment find reward meaning power beauty even little square box horrible situation,0

474,Guest," If we were to sit back totally relaxed, we could do the work. I think it's called pale blue dot thing or whatever, where we can imagine ourselves in this room. And then there were in the United States, in this continent, in the earth, and then peering down us and all of a sudden you get back. It can seem so big that all of a sudden it's meaningless. Right.

476,Guest, And that's beautiful. And it's what allows us to be so dynamic in different environments and we can pull from the past and the present and future.

478,Guest," But what I realized is that because we can get so fixated on the thing that we're experiencing holding tremendous meaning, but it only holds that meaning for as long as we are in that space time regime. And this is important because what really gives meaning is the understanding that you can move between these different space time dimensionality. And I'm not trying to sound like a theoretical physicist or anyone that thinks about the cosmos and saying that it's really the fact that sometimes we say and do and think things and it feels so important.",2021-06-05 02:32:04,realized get fixated thing experiencing holding tremendous meaning hold meaning long space time regime important really give meaning understanding move different space time dimensionality trying sound like theoretical physicist anyone think cosmos saying really fact sometimes say think thing feel important,0
