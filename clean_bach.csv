4,Lex Fridman," And now, here's my conversation with Joscha Bach.",1900-01-01 00:03:09,conversation joscha bach
5,Lex Fridman," As you've said, you grew up in a forest in East Germany (this is what we were talking about off-mic) to parents who were artists. And now I think, at least to me, you've become one of the most unique thinkers in the AI world. So can we try to reverse-engineer your mind a little bit? What were the key philosophers, scientists, ideas, maybe even movies, or just realizations that had an impact on you when you were growing up that kind of led to the trajectory or were the key sort of crossroads in the trajectory of your intellectual development?",1900-01-01 00:03:31,said grew forest east germany talking mic parent artist think least become one unique thinker ai world try reverse engineer mind little bit key philosopher scientist idea maybe even movie realization impact growing kind led trajectory key sort crossroad trajectory intellectual development
6,Joscha Bach," My father came from a long tradition of architects, a distant branch of the Bach family, and so basically he was technically a nerd, and nerds need to interface in society with non-standard ways. Sometimes I define a nerd as somebody who thinks that the purpose of communication is to submit your ideas to peer review. And normal people understand that the primary purpose of communication is to negotiate alignment, and these purposes tend to conflict, which means that nerds have to learn how to interact with society at large.",1900-01-01 00:04:06,father came long tradition architect distant branch bach family basically technically nerd nerd need interface society non standard way sometimes define nerd somebody think purpose communication submit idea peer review normal people understand primary purpose communication negotiate alignment purpose tend conflict mean nerd learn interact society large
7,Lex Fridman, Who is the reviewer in the nerds' view of communication?,1900-01-01 00:04:43,reviewer nerd view communication
8,Joscha Bach," Everybody who you consider to be a peer, so whatever hapless individual is around, well, you would try to make him or her the gift of information.",1900-01-01 00:04:48,everybody consider peer whatever hapless individual around well would try make gift information
9,Lex Fridman," Okay, so you're not, by the way, my research, well, mal-informed me. So your... architect or artist?",1900-01-01 00:04:59,okay way research well mal informed architect artist
10,Joscha Bach," He did study architecture, but, basically my grandfather made the wrong decision; he married an aristocrat and was drawn into into the war and he came back after 15 years. So basically, my father was not, parented by a nerd, but by somebody who tried to tell him what to do and expected him to do what he was told and he was unable to. He is unable to do things if he's not intrinsically motivated, so in some sense, my grandmother broke her son and her son responded by—when he became an architect—to become an artist. So he built Hundertwasser architecture. He built houses without right angles. He built lots of things that didn't work in the more Brutalist traditions of Eastern Germany. And so he bought an old watermill and moved out of the countryside and did only what he wanted to do, which was art. Eastern Germany was perfect for Boheme because you had complete material safety; food was heavily subsidized, healthcare was free—you didn't have to worry about rent or pensions or anything, so—",1900-01-01 00:05:07,study architecture basically grandfather made wrong decision married aristocrat drawn war came back year basically father parented nerd somebody tried tell expected told unable unable thing intrinsically motivated sense grandmother broke son son responded bywhen became architectto become artist built hundertwasser architecture built house without right angle built lot thing work brutalist tradition eastern germany bought old watermill moved countryside wanted art eastern germany perfect boheme complete material safety food heavily subsidized healthcare freeyou worry rent pension anything
11,Lex Fridman, So it was the socialized communist side of Germany—,1900-01-01 00:06:13,socialized communist side germany
12,Joscha Bach," Yes and the other thing is it was almost impossible not to be in political disagreement with your government, which is very productive for artists, so everything that you do is intrinsically meaningful because it will always touch on the deeper currents of society—of culture—and be in conflict with it, and tangent with it, and you will always have to define yourself with respect to this.",1900-01-01 00:06:15,yes thing almost impossible political disagreement government productive artist everything intrinsically meaningful always touch deeper current societyof cultureand conflict tangent always define respect
13,Lex Fridman," So what impact did your father, this... outside of the box thinker—against the government, against the world—artist, have in affecting your life?",1900-01-01 00:06:34,impact father outside box thinkeragainst government worldartist affecting life
14,Joscha Bach," He was actually not a thinker—he was somebody who only got self-aware to the degree that he needed to make himself functional. So in some sense, it was also in the late 1960s, and he was in some sense a hippie, so he became a one-person cult. He lived out there in his kingdom, he built big sculpture gardens and started many avenues of art and so on, and convinced a woman to live with him—she was also an architect—and she adored him and decided to share her life with him, and I basically grew up in a big cave full of books; I'm almost feral... and I was bored out there; it was very, very beautiful, very quiet, and quite lonely, so I started to read and by the time I came to school, I read everything until fourth grade and then some, and there was not a real way for me to relate to the outside world, and... I couldn't quite put my finger on why and today I know it was because I was nerd, obviously, and I was the only nerd around, so there were no other kids like me and there was nobody interested in physics or computing or mathematics and so on. And this village school that I went to was basically a nice school. Kids were nice to me. I was not beaten up, but I also didn't make many friends or build deep relationships; that only happened starting from ninth grade when I went to a school for mathematics and physics.",1900-01-01 00:06:43,actually thinkerhe somebody got self aware degree needed make functional sense also late sense hippie became one person cult lived kingdom built big sculpture garden started many avenue art convinced woman live himshe also architectand adored decided share life basically grew big cave full book almost feral bored beautiful quiet quite lonely started read time came school read everything fourth grade real way relate outside world quite put finger today know nerd obviously nerd around kid like nobody interested physic computing mathematics village school went basically nice school kid nice beaten also make many friend build deep relationship happened starting ninth grade went school mathematics physic
15,Lex Fridman, Do you remember any key books from this moment?,1900-01-01 00:08:06,remember key book moment
16,Joscha Bach," Yes, I basically read everything. So I went to the library and I worked my way through the children's and young adult sections and then I read a lot of science fiction. For instance, Stalislaw Lem, basically the great author of cybernetics, has influenced me. Back then, I didn't see him as a big influence because everything that he wrote seemed to be so natural to me. It's only later that I contrasted it with what other people wrote.",1900-01-01 00:08:08,yes basically read everything went library worked way child young adult section read lot science fiction instance stalislaw lem basically great author cybernetics influenced back see big influence everything wrote seemed natural later contrasted people wrote
17,Joscha Bach," Another thing that was very influential on me, were the classical philosophers and also the teacher of romanticism. So German poetry and art and Droste-Hülshoff and Heine and up to Hesse and so on.",1900-01-01 00:08:32,another thing influential classical philosopher also teacher romanticism german poetry art droste hlshoff heine hesse
18,Lex Fridman," Hesse, I love Hesse. So at which point did the classical philosophers end? At this point or in the 21st century, what's what's the latest classical philosopher? Does this stretch through even as far as Nietzsche or is this -are we talking about Plato and Aristotle?",1900-01-01 00:08:48,hesse love hesse point classical philosopher end point century latest classical philosopher stretch even far nietzsche talking plato aristotle
19,Joscha Bach," I think that Nietzsche is the classical equivalent of a shit poster. So he is very smart and easy to read and - yeah, but he's not so much trolling others, he is trolling himself because he was at odds with the world. Largely his romantic relationships didn't work out. He got angry and he basically became a nihilist.",1900-01-01 00:09:02,think nietzsche classical equivalent shit poster smart easy read yeah much trolling others trolling odds world largely romantic relationship work got angry basically became nihilist
20,Lex Fridman," And that is that a beautiful way to be as an intellectual is to constantly be trolling yourself to be in that conflict, in that no attention,",1900-01-01 00:09:21,beautiful way intellectual constantly trolling conflict attention
21,Joscha Bach," I think it's a lack of self-awareness. At some point, you have to understand the comedy of your own situation. If you take yourself seriously and you are not functional, it ends in tragedy, as it did for Nietzsche.",1900-01-01 00:09:32,think lack self awareness point understand comedy situation take seriously functional end tragedy nietzsche
22,Lex Fridman," I think, you think he took himself too seriously in that tension",1900-01-01 00:09:42,think think took seriously tension
23,Joscha Bach," Yeah! And you find the same thing in Hesse and so on, this Steppenwolf syndrome is classic adolescence where you basically feel misunderstood by the world and you don't understand that all the misunderstandings are the result of your own lack of self awareness. Because you think that you are a prototypical human and the others around you should behave the same way as you expect them based on your innate instincts, and it doesn't work out and you become a transcendentalist to deal with that.",1900-01-01 00:09:46,yeah find thing hesse steppenwolf syndrome classic adolescence basically feel misunderstood world understand misunderstanding result lack self awareness think prototypical human others around behave way expect based innate instinct work become transcendentalist deal
24,Joscha Bach," So it's very, very understandable and have great sympathy for this to the degree that I can have sympathy for my own intellectual history. But you have grow out of it.",1900-01-01 00:10:12,understandable great sympathy degree sympathy intellectual history grow
25,Lex Fridman," So as an intellectual, a life well lived, a journey well travelled is one where you don't take yourself seriously from your perspective?",1900-01-01 00:10:21,intellectual life well lived journey well travelled one take seriously perspective
26,Joscha Bach," No, I think that you are neither serious or not serious yourself because you need to become unimportant as a subject. That is, if you are a philosopher, belief is not a verb. You don't do this for the audience and you don't do it for yourself.",1900-01-01 00:10:28,think neither serious serious need become unimportant subject philosopher belief verb audience
27,Joscha Bach," You have to submit to the things that are possibly true and you have to follow wherever your enquiry leads, but it's not about you. It has nothing to do with you.",1900-01-01 00:10:44,submit thing possibly true follow wherever enquiry lead nothing
28,Lex Fridman," Do you think then people like Ayn Rand believed sort of an idea of that there is an objective truth? So what's your sense in the philosophical? If you remove yourself as subjective from the picture, you think it's possible to actually discover ideas that are true? Or are we just in a mesh of relative concepts that are neither true nor false? It's just a giant mess.",1900-01-01 00:10:53,think people like ayn rand believed sort idea objective truth sense philosophical remove subjective picture think possible actually discover idea true mesh relative concept neither true false giant mess
29,Joscha Bach," You cannot define objective truth without understanding the nature of truths in the first place. So, what does the brain mean by saying that it has discovered something as truth?",1900-01-01 00:11:14,cannot define objective truth without understanding nature truth first place brain mean saying discovered something truth
30,Joscha Bach," So, for instance, a model can be predictive or not predictive. Then there can be a sense in which a mathematical statement can be true because it's defined as true under certain conditions. So it's basically a particular state that a variable can have an assembled game and then you can have a correspondence between systems and talk about truth, which is again a type of model correspondence. And there also seems to be a particular kind of ground rules. So, for instance, you're confronted with the enormity of something existing at all.",1900-01-01 00:11:24,instance model predictive predictive sense mathematical statement true defined true certain condition basically particular state variable assembled game correspondence system talk truth type model correspondence also seems particular kind ground rule instance confronted enormity something existing
31,Joscha Bach," Right, that's stunning when you realize something exists rather than nothing. And this seems to be true. Right? There is an absolute truth in the fact that something seems to be happening.",1900-01-01 00:11:55,right stunning realize something exists rather nothing seems true right absolute truth fact something seems happening
32,Lex Fridman," Yeah, that's that to me is a showstopper. I can just think about that idea and be amazed by that idea for the rest of my life and not go any farther because I don't even know the answer to that. Why does anything exist at all?",1900-01-01 00:12:06,yeah showstopper think idea amazed idea rest life go farther even know answer anything exist
33,Joscha Bach," The easiest answer is existence is the default, right? So this is the lowest number of bits that you would need to encode this.",1900-01-01 00:12:18,easiest answer existence default right lowest number bit would need encode
34,Lex Fridman, Whose answer? Who brought...,1900-01-01 00:12:23,whose answer brought
35,Joscha Bach, The simplest answer to this is that existence is the default.,1900-01-01 00:12:24,simplest answer existence default
36,Lex Fridman," What about non-existence? I mean, that seems...",1900-01-01 00:12:28,non existence mean seems
37,Joscha Bach," Non-existence might not be a meaningful notion in this sense. So in some sense, if everything that can exist exists, for something to exist, it probably needs to be implementable. The only thing that can be implemented is finite automata. So maybe the whole of existence is the superposition of all finite automata. And we are in some region of the fractal that has the properties that it can contain us.",1900-01-01 00:12:30,non existence might meaningful notion sense sense everything exist exists something exist probably need implementable thing implemented finite automaton maybe whole existence superposition finite automaton region fractal property contain u
38,Lex Fridman," What does it mean to be a superposition of finite auto... Swinish superposition of all, like all possible rules?",1900-01-01 00:12:51,mean superposition finite auto swinish superposition like possible rule
39,Joscha Bach, Imagine that every automaton is basically an operator that acts on some substrate and as a result you get emergent patterns.,1900-01-01 00:12:59,imagine every automaton basically operator act substrate result get emergent pattern
40,Lex Fridman, what's the substrate?,1900-01-01 00:13:06,substrate
41,Joscha Bach," Um, I have no idea to know.",1900-01-01 00:13:08,um idea know
42,Lex Fridman," Or some substrate,",1900-01-01 00:13:10,substrate
43,Joscha Bach, it's something that can store information.,1900-01-01 00:13:11,something store information
44,Lex Fridman," something they can store information, there's automata...",1900-01-01 00:13:15,something store information automaton
45,Joscha Bach, Something that can hold state.,1900-01-01 00:13:17,something hold state
46,Lex Fridman," Still doesn't make sense to me the why that exists at all? I could just sit there with a with a beer or or a vodka and just enjoy the fact, pondering the why.",1900-01-01 00:13:18,still make sense exists could sit beer vodka enjoy fact pondering
47,Joscha Bach, May not have a why. This might be the wrong direction to ask into this.,1900-01-01 00:13:28,may might wrong direction ask
48,Joscha Bach, So there could be no relation in the why direction without asking for a purpose or for a cause. It doesn't mean that everything has to have a purpose or a cause. Right?,1900-01-01 00:13:32,could relation direction without asking purpose cause mean everything purpose cause right
49,Lex Fridman," So we mentioned some philosophers in that early, just taking a brief step back into into that.",1900-01-01 00:13:42,mentioned philosopher early taking brief step back
50,Joscha Bach," Ok, so we asked ourselves, when did classical philosophy end? I think for Germany it largely ended with the first revolution. That's basically when...",1900-01-01 00:13:48,ok asked classical philosophy end think germany largely ended first revolution basically
51,Lex Fridman, which one's that?,1900-01-01 00:13:56,one
52,Joscha Bach," This was when ended the monarchy and started a democracy. And at this point, we basically came up with a new form of government that didn't have a good sense of this new organism that society wanted to be and in a way it decapitated the universities. So the universities went on through modernism like a headless chicken.",1900-01-01 00:13:57,ended monarchy started democracy point basically came new form government good sense new organism society wanted way decapitated university university went modernism like headless chicken
53,Joscha Bach," At the same time, democracy failed in Germany and we got fascism as the result. And it burned down things in a similar way as Stalinism burned down intellectual traditions in Russia. And Germany, both Germanys, have not recovered from this. Eastern Germany had this vulgar dialectic materialism and western Germany didn't get much more edgy than Habermas. So in some sense, both countries lost their intellectual traditions, and killing off and driving out the Jews didn't help.",1900-01-01 00:14:16,time democracy failed germany got fascism result burned thing similar way stalinism burned intellectual tradition russia germany germany recovered eastern germany vulgar dialectic materialism western germany get much edgy habermas sense country lost intellectual tradition killing driving jew help
54,Lex Fridman," Yes, that was the end. That was the end of really rigorous of what you would say is classical classical philosophy.",1900-01-01 00:14:44,yes end end really rigorous would say classical classical philosophy
55,Joscha Bach," There's also this thing that in some sense, the low hanging fruits in philosophy were mostly wrapped. And the last big things that we discovered was the constructivist turn in mathematics. So to understand that the parts of mathematics that work are computation. There was a very significant discovery in the first half of the 20th century and it hasn't fully permeated philosophy and even physics yet. Physicists checked out the code libraries for mathematics before constructivism became universal.",1900-01-01 00:14:50,also thing sense low hanging fruit philosophy mostly wrapped last big thing discovered constructivist turn mathematics understand part mathematics work computation significant discovery first half century fully permeated philosophy even physic yet physicist checked code library mathematics constructivism became universal
56,Lex Fridman," Whats constructivism, what... Are you referring to Godel's incompleteness theorem, that kind of those kinds of ideas.",1900-01-01 00:15:24,whats constructivism referring godel incompleteness theorem kind kind idea
57,Joscha Bach," Yes. So basically, Godel himself, I think, didn't get it yet. Hilbert could get it. Hilbert saw that, for instance, a counters set theoretical experiments in mathematics led into contradictions. And he noticed that with the current semantics we cannot build a computer in mathematics that runs mathematics without crashing. And Godel could prove this. And so what Godel could show is: using classical mathematical semantics, you run into contradictions. And because Godel strongly believed in these semantics and more then in what you could observe and so on, he was shocked.",1900-01-01 00:15:29,yes basically godel think get yet hilbert could get hilbert saw instance counter set theoretical experiment mathematics led contradiction noticed current semantics cannot build computer mathematics run mathematics without crashing godel could prove godel could show using classical mathematical semantics run contradiction godel strongly believed semantics could observe shocked
58,Joscha Bach," It basically shook his world to the core because, in some sense, he felt that the world has to be implemented in classical mathematics.",1900-01-01 00:16:01,basically shook world core sense felt world implemented classical mathematics
59,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 00:16:07,yes
60,Joscha Bach," And for Turing, it wasn't quite so bad. I think that Turing could see that the solution is to understand that mathematics was computation all along, which means, for instance, PI in classical mathematics is a value. It's also a function, but it's the same thing. And in computation, a function is only a value when you can compute it. And if you cannot compute the last digit of PI, you only have a function.",1900-01-01 00:16:07,turing quite bad think turing could see solution understand mathematics computation along mean instance pi classical mathematics value also function thing computation function value compute cannot compute last digit pi function
61,Joscha Bach," You can plug this function into your local sun, let it run until the sun burns out, this is it. This is the last digit of pi, you will know. But it also means there can be no process in the physical universe or in any physically realized computer that depends on having known the last digit of PI.",1900-01-01 00:16:32,plug function local sun let run sun burn last digit pi know also mean process physical universe physically realized computer depends known last digit pi
62,Lex Fridman, Yes,1900-01-01 00:16:47,yes
63,Joscha Bach, Which means there are parts of physics that are defined in such a way that cannot strictly be true because assuming that this could be true leads into contradictions.,1900-01-01 00:16:48,mean part physic defined way cannot strictly true assuming could true lead contradiction
64,Lex Fridman, So I think putting computation at the center of the world view is actually the right way to think about it.,1900-01-01 00:16:55,think putting computation center world view actually right way think
65,Joscha Bach, Yes. And Wittgenstein could see it. And Wittgenstein basically preempted the largest program of A.I. that Minsky started later. Like 30 years later. Turing was actually a pupil of Wittgenstein. And...,1900-01-01 00:17:02,yes wittgenstein could see wittgenstein basically preempted largest program minsky started later like year later turing actually pupil wittgenstein
66,Lex Fridman, Really? I didn't know there's any connection between Turing and Wittgenstein...,1900-01-01 00:17:14,really know connection turing wittgenstein
67,Joscha Bach, Yeah! Wittgenstein even canceled some classes when Turing was not present because he thought it was not worth spending the time on with the others.,1900-01-01 00:17:17,yeah wittgenstein even canceled class turing present thought worth spending time others
68,Lex Fridman, That's interesting.,1900-01-01 00:17:22,interesting
69,Joscha Bach," If you read the Tractatus, it's a very beautiful book, basically one thought on 75 pages. It's very nontropical for philosophy because it doesn't have arguments in it and it doesn't have references in it. It's just one thought that is not intending to convince anybody. Thesis says it's mostly for people that had the same insight as me. Just spell it out. And this insight is: there is a way in which mathematics and philosophy ought to meet. Mathematics tries to understand the domain of all languages by starting with those that are so formalisable that you can prove all the properties of the statements that you make.",1900-01-01 00:17:24,read tractatus beautiful book basically one thought page nontropical philosophy argument reference one thought intending convince anybody thesis say mostly people insight spell insight way mathematics philosophy ought meet mathematics try understand domain language starting formalisable prove property statement make
70,Joscha Bach," But the price that you pay is that your language is very, very simple. So it's very hard to say something meaningful in mathematics.",1900-01-01 00:17:59,price pay language simple hard say something meaningful mathematics
71,Lex Fridman, Yes,1900-01-01 00:18:05,yes
72,Joscha Bach," And it looks complicated to people, but it's far less complicated than what our brain is casually doing all the time when it makes sense of reality.",1900-01-01 00:18:06,look complicated people far le complicated brain casually time make sense reality
73,Lex Fridman, That's right.,1900-01-01 00:18:12,right
74,Joscha Bach, And philosophy is coming from the top. So it's mostly starting from natural languages with vaguely defined concepts. And the hope is that mathematics and philosophy can meet at some point.,1900-01-01 00:18:13,philosophy coming top mostly starting natural language vaguely defined concept hope mathematics philosophy meet point
75,Joscha Bach," And Wittgenstein was trying to make them meet. And he already understood that, for instance, you could express everything with the NAND calculus, that you could produce the entire logic to NAND gates, as we do in our modern computers. So in some sense, he already understood Turing Universality before Turing spelled it out. I think when he wrote the Tractatus, he didn't understand yet that the idea was so important and significant. And I suspect then when Turing wrote it out, nobody cared that much. Turing was not that famous when he lived, it was mostly his work in decrypting the German codes that made him famous or gave him some notoriety. But this saint status that he has to computer science right now and A.I. is something that I think he got acquired later.",1900-01-01 00:18:23,wittgenstein trying make meet already understood instance could express everything nand calculus could produce entire logic nand gate modern computer sense already understood turing universality turing spelled think wrote tractatus understand yet idea important significant suspect turing wrote nobody cared much turing famous lived mostly work decrypting german code made famous gave notoriety saint status computer science right something think got acquired later
76,Lex Fridman," That's kind of interesting. Do you think of computation and computer science and you kind of represent that to me... Maybe that's the modern day... You, in a sense, are the new philosopher by... Sort of the computer scientist who dares to ask the bigger questions.

79,Joscha Bach," So I have to make my own models. I have to discover the foundations of what the others are saying, I have to try to fix them. To be charitable, I try to understand what they must have thought originally, or what their teachers or their teachers teachers must have thought until everything got lost in translation. And how to make sense of the reality that we are in.",1900-01-01 00:19:36,make model discover foundation others saying try fix charitable try understand must thought originally teacher teacher teacher must thought everything got lost translation make sense reality

81,Lex Fridman, The parties get smaller?,1900-01-01 00:20:04,party get smaller
82,Joscha Bach, and more exclusive,1900-01-01 00:20:05,exclusive
83,Lex Fridman," and more exclusive. So it seems like one of the key qualities of your upbringing was that you were not tethered. Whether it's because your parents or in general, maybe you're something within your within your mind, some genetic material.",1900-01-01 00:20:06,exclusive seems like one key quality upbringing tethered whether parent general maybe something within within mind genetic material
84,Lex Fridman," They were not tethered to the ideas of the general populace, which is actually a unique property. We're kind of, you know, the education system and whatever from the education system, just existing in this world forces a certain set of ideas into you. Can you disentangle that?",1900-01-01 00:20:22,tethered idea general populace actually unique property kind know education system whatever education system existing world force certain set idea disentangle

86,Lex Fridman," Being tethered to particular things that current today. In this year, people seem to value as a thing you put on your CV and resume. You're a little bit more outside of that world, outside of the world of ideas that people especially focus on the benchmarks of today, the things what can you disentangle that? Because I think that's inspiring. And if there were more people like that, we might be able to solve some of the bigger problems that sort of AI dreams to solve.",1900-01-01 00:20:53,tethered particular thing current today year people seem value thing put cv resume little bit outside world outside world idea people especially focus benchmark today thing disentangle think inspiring people like might able solve bigger problem sort ai dream solve
87,Joscha Bach," There's a big danger in this, because, in a way, you are expected to marry into an intellectual tradition and within this tradition into a particular school. If everybody comes up with their own paradigms, the whole thing is not cumulative as an enterprise.",1900-01-01 00:21:22,big danger way expected marry intellectual tradition within tradition particular school everybody come paradigm whole thing cumulative enterprise
88,Lex Fridman, Right.,1900-01-01 00:21:37,right
89,Joscha Bach," So in some sense, you need a healthy balance. You need paradigmatic thinkers and you need people that work within given paradigms. Basically scientists today define themselves largely by methods. And it's almost a disease that we think as a scientist, somebody who was convinced by their guidance counselor that they should join a particular discipline and then they find a good mentor to learn the right methods and then they are lucky enough and privileged enough to join the right team. And then their name will show up on influential papers. But we also see that there are diminishing returns with this approach.",1900-01-01 00:21:37,sense need healthy balance need paradigmatic thinker need people work within given paradigm basically scientist today define largely method almost disease think scientist somebody convinced guidance counselor join particular discipline find good mentor learn right method lucky enough privileged enough join right team name show influential paper also see diminishing return approach
90,Joscha Bach," And when our field computer science AI started, most of the people that joined this field had interesting opinions. And today's thinkers in A.I. either don't have interesting opinions at all, or these opinions are inconsequential for what they're actually doing. Because what they're doing is, they apply the state of the art methods with a small epsilon. And this is often a good idea if you think that this is the best way to make progress. And for me it's, first of all, very boring. If somebody else can do it, why should I do it, right? If the current methods of machine learning lead to strong A.I., why should I be doing it? Right?",1900-01-01 00:22:10,field computer science ai started people joined field interesting opinion today thinker either interesting opinion opinion inconsequential actually apply state art method small epsilon often good idea think best way make progress first boring somebody else right current method machine learning lead strong right
91,Joscha Bach," I will just wait until they're done and wait until they do this on the beach. Or read interesting books or write them and have fun. But if you don't think that we're currently doing the right thing, if we are missing some perspectives, then it's required to think outside of the box. It's also required to understand the boxes. But it's necessary to understand what worked and what didn't work and for what reasons. So you have to be willing to ask new questions and design new methods whenever you want to answer them.",1900-01-01 00:22:48,wait done wait beach read interesting book write fun think currently right thing missing perspective required think outside box also required understand box necessary understand worked work reason willing ask new question design new method whenever want answer
92,Joscha Bach, And you have to be willing to dismiss the existing methods if you think that they're not going to yield the right answers. It's very bad career advice to do that.,1900-01-01 00:23:21,willing dismiss existing method think going yield right answer bad career advice
93,Lex Fridman," So maybe to briefly stay for one more time in the early days, when would you say for you was the dream -before we dive into the discussions that we just almost started- when was the dream to understand or maybe to create human level intelligence born for you?",1900-01-01 00:23:30,maybe briefly stay one time early day would say dream dive discussion almost started dream understand maybe create human level intelligence born
94,Joscha Bach," I think that you can see AI largely today as advanced information processing. If you would change the acronym of A.I. into that, most people in the field would be happy. It would not change anything what they're doing . We're automating statistics and many of the statistical models are more advanced than what statisticians had in the past. And it's pretty good work. It's very productive.",1900-01-01 00:23:52,think see ai largely today advanced information processing would change acronym people field would happy would change anything automating statistic many statistical model advanced statistician past pretty good work productive
95,Joscha Bach, And the other aspect of AI is this philosophical project. And this philosophical project is very risky. And very few people work on it and it's not clear if it succeeds.,1900-01-01 00:24:16,aspect ai philosophical project philosophical project risky people work clear succeeds
96,Lex Fridman," So first of all, you keep throwing sort of a lot of really interesting ideas. And I have to pick which ones we go with. But sort of... First of all, you use the term information processing. Just information processing, as if it's it's the mere... It's the muck of existence, as if it's the epitome of that, that the entirety of the universe may be information processes, that consciousness and intelligence might be information... So that maybe you can comment on if that's... If the advanced information processing is is a limiting kind of realm of ideas. And then the other one is, what do you mean by the philosophical project?",1900-01-01 00:24:27,first keep throwing sort lot really interesting idea pick one go sort first use term information processing information processing mere muck existence epitome entirety universe may information process consciousness intelligence might information maybe comment advanced information processing limiting kind realm idea one mean philosophical project
97,Joscha Bach," So I suspect that general intelligence is the result of trying to solve general problems. So intelligence, I think, is the ability to model. It's not necessarily goal directed rationality or something, many intelligent people are bad at this. But it's the ability to be presented with a number of patterns and see a structure in those patterns and be able to predict the next set of patterns, to make sense of things. And some problems are a very general, usually intelligence serves control, so you make these models for a particular purpose of interacting as an agent with the world and getting certain results. But it's... The intelligence itself is, in the sense instrumental to something. But by itself, it's just the ability to make models. And some of the problems are so general that the system that makes them needs to understand what itself is and how it relates to the environment. So as a child, for instance, you notice you do certain things despite you perceiving yourself as wanting different things.",1900-01-01 00:25:08,suspect general intelligence result trying solve general problem intelligence think ability model necessarily goal directed rationality something many intelligent people bad ability presented number pattern see structure pattern able predict next set pattern make sense thing problem general usually intelligence serf control make model particular purpose interacting agent world getting certain result intelligence sense instrumental something ability make model problem general system make need understand relates environment child instance notice certain thing despite perceiving wanting different thing
98,Joscha Bach," So you become aware of your own psychology. You become aware of the fact that you have complex structure in yourself and you need to model yourself to reverse engineer yourself, to be able to predict how you will react to certain situations and how you deal with yourself in relationship to your environment. And this process, this project, if you reverse engineer yourself and your relationship to reality and the nature of a universe that can continue, if you go all the way, this is basically the project of A.I. or you could say the project of AI is a very important component in it.",1900-01-01 00:26:07,become aware psychology become aware fact complex structure need model reverse engineer able predict react certain situation deal relationship environment process project reverse engineer relationship reality nature universe continue go way basically project could say project ai important component
99,Joscha Bach," The true Turing test in a way is, you ask a system: what is intelligence? If that system is able to explain what it is, how it works, then you should assign it a property of being intelligent in this general sense. So the test that Turing was administering in a way -I don't think that he couldn't see it, but he didn't express it yet in the original 1950 paper- is that he was trying to find out whether he was generally intelligent. Because in order to take this test, the rub is, of course, you need to be able to understand what that system is saying. And we don't yet know if we can build an A.I., we don't yet know if we are generally intelligent. Basically, you win the Turing test by building an AI.",1900-01-01 00:26:38,true turing test way ask system intelligence system able explain work assign property intelligent general sense test turing administering way think see express yet original paper trying find whether generally intelligent order take test rub course need able understand system saying yet know build yet know generally intelligent basically win turing test building ai
100,Lex Fridman," Yes. So so in a sense, hidden within the Turing test is a kind of recursive test.",1900-01-01 00:27:18,yes sense hidden within turing test kind recursive test
101,Joscha Bach," Yes, it's a test on us. The Turing test is basically a test of the conjecture whether people are intelligent enough to understand themselves.",1900-01-01 00:27:23,yes test u turing test basically test conjecture whether people intelligent enough understand
102,Lex Fridman," OK, but you also mentioned a little bit of a self-awareness and then the project of AI... Do you think this kind of emergent self-awareness is one of the fundamental aspects of intelligence?",1900-01-01 00:27:32,ok also mentioned little bit self awareness project ai think kind emergent self awareness one fundamental aspect intelligence
103,Lex Fridman," So as opposed to goal oriented, as you said kind of puzzle solving as coming to grips with the idea that you're an agent in the world and...",1900-01-01 00:27:43,opposed goal oriented said kind puzzle solving coming grip idea agent world
104,Joscha Bach," I find that many highly intelligent people are not very self-aware. Right? So self-awareness and intelligence are not the same thing. And you can also be self-aware if you have good priors especially, without being especially intelligent. So you don't need to be very good at solving puzzles if the system that you are, already implements the solution.",1900-01-01 00:27:56,find many highly intelligent people self aware right self awareness intelligence thing also self aware good prior especially without especially intelligent need good solving puzzle system already implement solution
105,Lex Fridman," But I do find intelligence... So you kind of mentioned children, right? Is that the fundamental project of A.I.? Is to create the learning system that's able to exist in the world. So you kind of drew a difference in self-awareness and intelligence.",1900-01-01 00:28:15,find intelligence kind mentioned child right fundamental project create learning system able exist world kind drew difference self awareness intelligence
106,Lex Fridman, And yet you said that the self-awareness seems to be important for children.,1900-01-01 00:28:34,yet said self awareness seems important child
107,Joscha Bach," So I call this ability to make sense of the world and your own place in it, so to make you able to understand what you are doing in this world, sentience. And I would distinguish sentience from intelligence, because sentience is possessing certain classes of models. And intelligence is the way to get to these models if you don't already have them.",1900-01-01 00:28:40,call ability make sense world place make able understand world sentience would distinguish sentience intelligence sentience possessing certain class model intelligence way get model already
108,Lex Fridman, I see. So... Can you can you maybe pause a bit and try to answer the question that we just said we may not be able to answer and it might be a recursive meta-question of what is intelligence?,1900-01-01 00:29:01,see maybe pause bit try answer question said may able answer might recursive meta question intelligence
109,Joscha Bach, I think that intelligence is the ability to make models.,1900-01-01 00:29:17,think intelligence ability make model
110,Lex Fridman," So models. I think it's useful as examples, very popular now, neural networks form representations of large scale data set, they form models of those data sets. When you say models and look at today's neural networks, what are the difference of how you're thinking about what is intelligent in saying that intelligence is the process of making models.",1900-01-01 00:29:20,model think useful example popular neural network form representation large scale data set form model data set say model look today neural network difference thinking intelligent saying intelligence process making model
111,Joscha Bach," There are two aspects to to this question. One is the representation: is the representation adequate for the domain that we want to represent? And the other one is: is the type of the model that you arrive at adequate? So basically, are you modeling the correct domain? And I think in both of these cases, modern A.I. Is lacking still. And I think that I'm not saying anything new. I'm not criticizing the field. Most of the people that design our paradigms are aware of that. And so one aspect that we are missing is unified learning.",1900-01-01 00:29:48,two aspect question one representation representation adequate domain want represent one type model arrive adequate basically modeling correct domain think case modern lacking still think saying anything new criticizing field people design paradigm aware one aspect missing unified learning
112,Joscha Bach," When we learn, we at some point discover that everything that we sense is part of the same object. Which means we learn it all into one model and we call this model the universe. So our experience of the world that we are embedded on is not a secret direct wire to physical reality. Physical reality is a weird quantum graph that we can never experience or get access to. But it has these properties that it can create certain patterns at our systemic interface to the world.",1900-01-01 00:30:21,learn point discover everything sense part object mean learn one model call model universe experience world embedded secret direct wire physical reality physical reality weird quantum graph never experience get access property create certain pattern systemic interface world
113,Joscha Bach," And we make sense of these patterns and the relationship between the patterns that we discover is what we call the physical universe. So at some point in our development as a nervous system, we discover that everything that we relate to in the world can be mapped to a region in the same three dimensional space, by and large. We now know in physics that this is not quite true, the World is not actually Three-Dimensional. But the world that we are entangled with, at a level which we are entangled with, is largely a flat, three dimensional space.",1900-01-01 00:30:47,make sense pattern relationship pattern discover call physical universe point development nervous system discover everything relate world mapped region three dimensional space large know physic quite true world actually three dimensional world entangled level entangled largely flat three dimensional space
114,Joscha Bach," And so this is the model that our brain is intuitively making. And this is, I think, what gave rise to this intuition of Res extensa, of this material world, this material domain. It's one of the mental domains, but it's just the class of all models that relate to this environment as three dimensional physics engine in which we are embedded.",1900-01-01 00:31:18,model brain intuitively making think gave rise intuition re extensa material world material domain one mental domain class model relate environment three dimensional physic engine embedded
115,Lex Fridman," Physics engine in which were embedded...I love that. Lets just slowly pause. So the quantum graph, I think you called which is the real world which you can never get access to.",1900-01-01 00:31:36,physic engine embedded love let slowly pause quantum graph think called real world never get access
116,Lex Fridman," There's a bunch of questions I want to sort of disentangle that, but maybe one useful one, one of your recent talks I looked at. Can you just describe the basics?",1900-01-01 00:31:51,bunch question want sort disentangle maybe one useful one one recent talk looked describe basic
117,Lex Fridman," Can you talk about what is dualism, what idealism, what is materialism, what is functionalism and what connects with you most? In terms of, because you just mentioned there's a reality we don't have access to. OK, what does that even mean? And why don't we get access to it? Aren't we part of that reality? Why don't we... Why can we access it?",1900-01-01 00:32:00,talk dualism idealism materialism functionalism connects term mentioned reality access ok even mean get access part reality access
118,Joscha Bach, So the particular trajectory that mostly exists in the West is the result of our indoctrination by a cult for 2000 years.,1900-01-01 00:32:20,particular trajectory mostly exists west result indoctrination cult year
119,Lex Fridman, a cult? which one...,1900-01-01 00:32:27,cult one

121,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 00:32:30,yes
122,Joscha Bach," And for better or worse, it has created or defined many of the modes of interaction that we have that have created this society. But it has also, in some sense, scarred our rationality. And the intuition that exists, if you would translate the mythology of the Catholic Church into the modern world, is that the world in which you and me interact is something like a multiplayer role playing adventure.",1900-01-01 00:32:30,better worse created defined many mode interaction created society also sense scarred rationality intuition exists would translate mythology catholic church modern world world interact something like multiplayer role playing adventure

125,Joscha Bach," Or as eastern philosophers would say, it's Maya. It's just stuff that appears to be meaningful. And this embedding in this meaning, if you believe in it, it's samsara. It's basically the identification with the needs of the mundane, secular, everyday existence. And the Catholics also introduced the notion of higher meaning, the sacred. And this existed before. But eventually the natural shape of God is the platonic form of the civilization that you're a part of. It's basically the super organism that is formed by the individuals as an intentional agent.",1900-01-01 00:33:02,eastern philosopher would say maya stuff appears meaningful embedding meaning believe samsara basically identification need mundane secular everyday existence catholic also introduced notion higher meaning sacred existed eventually natural shape god platonic form civilization part basically super organism formed individual intentional agent
126,Joscha Bach," And basically the Catholics used a relatively crude mythology to implement software on the minds of people and get the software synchronized to make them walk in lockstep to basically get this God online and to make it efficient and effective. And I think God technically is just a self that spans multiple brains as opposed to your and my self, which mostly exists just on one brain. Right? And so in some sense, you can construct a self functionally as a function that's implemented by brains that exists across brains. And this is a God with a small G.",1900-01-01 00:33:37,basically catholic used relatively crude mythology implement software mind people get software synchronized make walk lockstep basically get god online make efficient effective think god technically self span multiple brain opposed self mostly exists one brain right sense construct self functionally function implemented brain exists across brain god small g
127,Lex Fridman," That's one of the few Yuval Harari kind of talking about is this is one of the nice features of our brains, it seems to that we can all download the same piece of software like god in this case and kind of share it.",1900-01-01 00:34:11,one yuval harari kind talking one nice feature brain seems download piece software like god case kind share
128,Joscha Bach," Yeah, so basically you give everybody a spec and the mathematical constraints that are intrinsic to information processing make sure that given the same spec, you come up with a compatible structure.",1900-01-01 00:34:25,yeah basically give everybody spec mathematical constraint intrinsic information processing make sure given spec come compatible structure
129,Lex Fridman," OK, so that's there's a space of ideas that we all share and we think that's kind of the mind. But that's separate from the idea is from from Christianity, for from religion is that there's a separate thing between the mind...",1900-01-01 00:34:36,ok space idea share think kind mind separate idea christianity religion separate thing mind
130,Joscha Bach," There is a real world. And this real world is the world in which God exists. God is the coder of the multiplayer adventure, so to speak. And we are all players in this game.",1900-01-01 00:34:53,real world real world world god exists god coder multiplayer adventure speak player game
131,Lex Fridman," And that's dualism, you would say.",1900-01-01 00:35:02,dualism would say
132,Joscha Bach," But the dualist aspect is, because the mental realm is exists in the different implementation than the physical realm and the mental realm is real. And a lot of people have this intuition that there's this real room in which you and me talk and speak right now. Then comes a layer of physics and abstract rules and so on. And then comes another real room where our souls are. And our true form isn't a thing that gives us phenomenal experience.",1900-01-01 00:35:05,dualist aspect mental realm exists different implementation physical realm mental realm real lot people intuition real room talk speak right come layer physic abstract rule come another real room soul true form thing give u phenomenal experience
133,Joscha Bach, And this of course is a very confused notion that you would get. And it's basically it's the result of connecting materialism and idealism in the wrong way.,1900-01-01 00:35:30,course confused notion would get basically result connecting materialism idealism wrong way
134,Lex Fridman," So, OK, I apologize, but I think it's really helpful if we just try to define, try to define terms like what is dualism, what does idealism, what is materialism for people don't know.",1900-01-01 00:35:41,ok apologize think really helpful try define try define term like dualism idealism materialism people know
135,Joscha Bach," So the idea of dualism in our cultural tradition is that there are two substances: a mental substance and a physical substance. And they interact by different rules. And the physical world is basically causally closed and is built on a low level causal structure. So they're basically a bottom level that is causally closed, that's entirely mechanical and mechanical in the widest sense, so it's computational. There's basically a physical world in which information flows around and physics describes the laws of how information flows around in this world.",1900-01-01 00:35:51,idea dualism cultural tradition two substance mental substance physical substance interact different rule physical world basically causally closed built low level causal structure basically bottom level causally closed entirely mechanical mechanical widest sense computational basically physical world information flow around physic describes law information flow around world
136,Lex Fridman, Would you compare it to? Like a computer or you have a hardware and software.,1900-01-01 00:36:23,would compare like computer hardware software
137,Joscha Bach," The computer is a generalization of information flowing around. Basically, What Turing discovered, that as the universal principle, you can define this universal machine that is able to perform all the computations so all these machines have the same power. This means that you can always define a translation between them as long as they have unlimited memory, to be able to perform each other's computations.",1900-01-01 00:36:27,computer generalization information flowing around basically turing discovered universal principle define universal machine able perform computation machine power mean always define translation long unlimited memory able perform computation
138,Lex Fridman, So would you then say that materialism is this whole world is just the hardware and idealism is this whole world is just a software?,1900-01-01 00:36:51,would say materialism whole world hardware idealism whole world software
139,Joscha Bach," Uh, not quite. I think that most idealists don't have a notion of software yet. Because software also comes down to information processing. Right. So what you notice is the only thing that is real to you and me is this experiential world in which things matter, in which things have taste and which things of color, phenomenal content and so on.",1900-01-01 00:36:58,uh quite think idealist notion software yet software also come information processing right notice thing real experiential world thing matter thing taste thing color phenomenal content
140,Lex Fridman," You are bringing up consciousness, OK?",1900-01-01 00:37:16,bringing consciousness ok
141,Joscha Bach," And this is distinct from the physical world in which things have values only in an abstract sense, and you only look at cold patterns moving around.",1900-01-01 00:37:18,distinct physical world thing value abstract sense look cold pattern moving around
142,Joscha Bach," and we are the result of these models. And in some sense, I don't think that we should understand, if you understand it properly, materialism and idealism as a dichotomy, but as two different aspects of the same thing. So the weird thing is we don't exist in the physical world. We do exist inside of a story that the brain tells itself.",1900-01-01 00:38:02,result model sense think understand understand properly materialism idealism dichotomy two different aspect thing weird thing exist physical world exist inside story brain tell
143,Joscha Bach," So, how does anything feel like something? And this connection between the two things is is very puzzling to a lot of people, and of course, to many philosophers. So, Idealism starts out with the notion that Mind is primary. Materialism thinks that Matter is primary. And so, for the Idealist, the material patterns that we see playing out are part of the dream that the mind is dreaming. And we exist in the mind on a higher plane of existence, if you want. And for the Materialist, there is only this material thing, and that generates some models,",1900-01-01 00:38:02,anything feel like something connection two thing puzzling lot people course many philosopher idealism start notion mind primary materialism think matter primary idealist material pattern see playing part dream mind dreaming exist mind higher plane existence want materialist material thing generates model
144,Lex Fridman," OK, let me get my information processing I take to take that in. We don't exist in the physical world. We exist in a narrative.",1900-01-01 00:38:23,ok let get information processing take take exist physical world exist narrative
145,Joscha Bach," Basically, a brain cannot feel anything. A neuron cannot feel anything. They're physical things. Physical systems are unable to experience anything. But it would be very useful for the brain or for the organism to know what it would be like to be a person and to feel something. So the brain creates a simulacrum of such a person that it uses to model the interactions of the person. It's the best model of what that brain, this organism thinks it is in relationship to its environment.",1900-01-01 00:38:34,basically brain cannot feel anything neuron cannot feel anything physical thing physical system unable experience anything would useful brain organism know would like person feel something brain creates simulacrum person us model interaction person best model brain organism think relationship environment
146,Joscha Bach," So it creates that model. It's a story, a multimedia novel that the brain is continuously writing and updating.",1900-01-01 00:38:59,creates model story multimedia novel brain continuously writing updating
147,Lex Fridman, But you also kind of said that you said that we kind of exist in that that story what is real in any of this.,1900-01-01 00:39:04,also kind said said kind exist story real
148,Lex Fridman," So, like, there's, again, these terms are you kind of said there's a quantum graph. I mean, what is what is this whole thing running on then is the story",1900-01-01 00:39:16,like term kind said quantum graph mean whole thing running story
149,Lex Fridman," and is it completely, fundamentally impossible to get access to it? Because isn't the story supposed to is in the brain in a in in something in existing in some kind of context?",1900-01-01 00:39:27,completely fundamentally impossible get access story supposed brain something existing kind context
150,Joscha Bach," So what we can identify as computer scientists, we can engineer systems and test our theories this way that may have the necessary and sufficient properties to produce the phenomena that we're observing. Which is there is the self in a virtual world that is generated in somebody's neocortex, that is contained in the skull of this primate here. And when I point at this, this indexicality is, of course, wrong. But I do create something that is likely to give rise to patterns on your retina that allow you to interpret what I'm saying.",1900-01-01 00:39:41,identify computer scientist engineer system test theory way may necessary sufficient property produce phenomenon observing self virtual world generated somebody neocortex contained skull primate point indexicality course wrong create something likely give rise pattern retina allow interpret saying
151,Joscha Bach, Right. But we both know that the world that you and me are seeing is not the real physical world. What we are seeing is a virtual reality generated in your brain to explain the patterns on your retina.,1900-01-01 00:40:14,right know world seeing real physical world seeing virtual reality generated brain explain pattern retina
152,Lex Fridman, How close is it to the real world?,1900-01-01 00:40:24,close real world
153,Lex Fridman," That's kind of the question. Is that when you have when you have like people like Donna Hoffman, as say that, like that, you're really far away. The thing we're seeing, you and I now, that interface we have is very far away from anything. Like we don't even have anything close, like to the sense of what the real world is or is it a very surface piece of architecture.",1900-01-01 00:40:26,kind question like people like donna hoffman say like really far away thing seeing interface far away anything like even anything close like sense real world surface piece architecture
154,Joscha Bach," Imagine you look at the Mandelbrot fractal, right? This famous thing that Benoît Mandelbrot discovered. If you see an overall shape in there. Right. But, you know that, if you truly understand it, you know, it's two lines of code. It's basically a series that is being tested for complex numbers in a complex number plane for every point and for those where the series is diverging, you paint this black and where it's converging you don't and you get the intermediate colors by taking how fast it diverges.",1900-01-01 00:40:48,imagine look mandelbrot fractal right famous thing benot mandelbrot discovered see overall shape right know truly understand know two line code basically series tested complex number complex number plane every point series diverging paint black converging get intermediate color taking fast diverges
155,Joscha Bach," This gives you this shape of this fractal. But imagine you live inside of this fractal and you don't have access to where you are in the fractal or you have not discovered the generator function even. Right. So what you see is, all I can see right now is the spiral and the spiral moves a little bit to the right. Is this an accurate model of reality? Yes, it is. Right. It is an adequate description. You know, that there is actually no spiral in the Mandelbrot fractal.",1900-01-01 00:41:26,give shape fractal imagine live inside fractal access fractal discovered generator function even right see see right spiral spiral move little bit right accurate model reality yes right adequate description know actually spiral mandelbrot fractal
156,Joscha Bach," It only appears like this to an observer that is interpreting things as a two dimensional space and then defines certain regularities in there at a certain scale that are currently observed, because if you zoom in, the spiral might disappear, turn out to be something different at a different resolution, right? so at this level, you have the spiral and then you discover the spiral moves to the right and some point it disappears. So you have a singularity.",1900-01-01 00:41:50,appears like observer interpreting thing two dimensional space defines certain regularity certain scale currently observed zoom spiral might disappear turn something different different resolution right level spiral discover spiral move right point disappears singularity
157,Joscha Bach," At this point, your model is no longer valid. You cannot predict what happens beyond the singularity, but you can observe again and you will see it in another spiral. And at this point it disappears. So we know of a second order law. And if you make thirty layers of these laws, then you have a description of the world that is similar to the one that we come up with when we describe the reality around us. It's reasonably predictive, it does not cut to the core of it. It does not explain how it's being generated, how it actually works. But it's relatively good to explain the universe that we're entangled with.",1900-01-01 00:42:11,point model longer valid cannot predict happens beyond singularity observe see another spiral point disappears know second order law make thirty layer law description world similar one come describe reality around u reasonably predictive cut core explain generated actually work relatively good explain universe entangled
158,Lex Fridman," But you don't think the tools of computer science, of the tools of physics could get could step outside, see the whole drawing and get at the basic mechanism of how the pattern, the spirals are generated?",1900-01-01 00:42:42,think tool computer science tool physic could get could step outside see whole drawing get basic mechanism pattern spiral generated
159,Joscha Bach," Um, imagine you would find yourself embedded into a Mandelbrot fractal and you try to figure out what works. And you you know, some have a Turing machine, there's enough memory to think. And as a result, you come to this idea, it must be some kind of automaton and maybe you just enumerate all the possible automata until you get to the one that produces your reality. So you can identify necessary and sufficient condition. For instance, if we discover that mathematics itself is the domain of all languages.",1900-01-01 00:42:53,um imagine would find embedded mandelbrot fractal try figure work know turing machine enough memory think result come idea must kind automaton maybe enumerate possible automaton get one produce reality identify necessary sufficient condition instance discover mathematics domain language
160,Joscha Bach," And then we see that most of the domains of mathematics that we have discovered are in some sense describing the same fractals. This is what category theory is obsessed about, that you can map these different domains to each other. So they're not that many fractals. And some of these have interesting structure and symmetry breaks. And so you can discover what region of this global fractal you might be embedded in from first principles. but the only way you can get there is from first principles.",1900-01-01 00:43:20,see domain mathematics discovered sense describing fractal category theory obsessed map different domain many fractal interesting structure symmetry break discover region global fractal might embedded first principle way get first principle
161,Joscha Bach, So basically your understanding of the universe has to start with automata and the number theory and then spaces and so on.,1900-01-01 00:43:47,basically understanding universe start automaton number theory space
162,Lex Fridman," Yeah, I think like Stephen Wolfram still dreams that he's that he'll be able to arrive at the fundamental rules of the cellular automata or the generalization of which is behind our universe.",1900-01-01 00:43:53,yeah think like stephen wolfram still dream able arrive fundamental rule cellular automaton generalization behind universe
163,Lex Fridman," Yeah, it's. You've said on this topic, you said in a recent conversation that, quote, Some people think that a simulation can't be conscious and only a physical system can. But it got a completely backward: a physical system cannot be conscious. Only a simulation can be conscious. Consciousness is a simulated property that simulated itself. Just like you said, the mind is kind of the call it story narrative. There's a simulation or so our mind is essentially a simulation.",1900-01-01 00:44:04,yeah said topic said recent conversation quote people think simulation conscious physical system got completely backward physical system cannot conscious simulation conscious consciousness simulated property simulated like said mind kind call story narrative simulation mind essentially simulation
164,Joscha Bach," Usually I try to use the terminology so that the mind is basically the principles that produced the simulation. It's the software that is implemented by your brain and the mind is creating both the universe that we are in and the self, the idea of a person that is on the other side of attention and is embedded in this world.",1900-01-01 00:44:37,usually try use terminology mind basically principle produced simulation software implemented brain mind creating universe self idea person side attention embedded world
165,Lex Fridman, Why is that important? That idea of a self. Why is that an important feature in the simulation.,1900-01-01 00:44:56,important idea self important feature simulation
166,Joscha Bach," It's basically a result of the purpose that the mind has. It's a tool for modeling, right? We are not actually monkeys. We are side effects of the regulation needs of monkeys. And what the monkey has to regulate is the relationship of an organism to an outside world that is in large part also consisting of other organisms. And as a result, it basically has regulation targets that it tries to get to. These regulation targets start with priors, they are basically like unconditional reflexes that we are more or less born with, and then we can reverse engineer them to make them more consistent.",1900-01-01 00:45:03,basically result purpose mind tool modeling right actually monkey side effect regulation need monkey monkey regulate relationship organism outside world large part also consisting organism result basically regulation target try get regulation target start prior basically like unconditional reflex le born reverse engineer make consistent
167,Joscha Bach," And then we get more detailed models about how the world works and how to interact with it. And so these priors that you commit to a largely target values that our needs should approach, set points, and this deviation to the set point creates some urge, some tension. And we find ourselves living inside of feedback loops. Right. Consciousness emerges over dimensions of disagreements with the universe, things where you care, things are not the way they should be, where you need to regulate.",1900-01-01 00:45:38,get detailed model world work interact prior commit largely target value need approach set point deviation set point creates urge tension find living inside feedback loop right consciousness emerges dimension disagreement universe thing care thing way need regulate
168,Joscha Bach," So in some sense, the sense of self is the result of all the identifications that you are having. And an identification is a regulation target that you're committing to. It's a dimension that you care about, you think is important. And this is also what locks you in. If you let go of these commitments, of these identifications, you get free. There's nothing that you have to do anymore. And if you let go of all of them, you're completely free and you can enter Nirvana because you're done.",1900-01-01 00:46:06,sense sense self result identification identification regulation target committing dimension care think important also lock let go commitment identification get free nothing anymore let go completely free enter nirvana done
169,Lex Fridman," And actually, this is a good time to pause and say thank you to a friend of mine, Gustav Söderström, who introduced me to your work. I wanted to give him a shout out. He's a brilliant guy. And I think the AI community is actually quite amazing and is a good representative of that, you are as well. So I'm I'm glad. First of all, I'm glad the Internet exists, youtube exist, where I can watch your talks and then get to your book and study your writing and think about, you know, that's amazing.",1900-01-01 00:46:31,actually good time pause say thank friend mine gustav sderstrm introduced work wanted give shout brilliant guy think ai community actually quite amazing good representative well glad first glad internet exists youtube exist watch talk get book study writing think know amazing
170,Lex Fridman," OK, but the you've kind of described to me this emergent phenomena of consciousness from the simulation. So what about the hard problem of consciousness? Can you just linger on it, like why does it still feel, like I understand you're kind of the self is an important part of the simulation? But why does the simulation feel like something?",1900-01-01 00:47:00,ok kind described emergent phenomenon consciousness simulation hard problem consciousness linger like still feel like understand kind self important part simulation simulation feel like something
171,Joscha Bach," So if you look at a book by, say, George R.R. Martin, where the characters have plausible psychology and they stand on a hill because they want to conquer the city below the hill and they're done in it, and they look at the color of the sky and they are apprehensive and feel empowered and all these things.",1900-01-01 00:47:27,look book say george r r martin character plausible psychology stand hill want conquer city hill done look color sky apprehensive feel empowered thing
172,Joscha Bach, Why do they have these emotions? It's because it's written into the story. Right. And it's written to the story because it's an adequate model of the person that predicts what they're going to do next. And the same thing is for us.,1900-01-01 00:47:42,emotion written story right written story adequate model person predicts going next thing u
173,Joscha Bach," So it's basically a story that our brain is writing. It's not written in words, it's written in perceptual content, basically multimedia content. And it's a model of what the person would feel if it existed. So it's a virtual person and you and me happen to be this virtual persons. So this virtual person gets access to the language center and talks about the sky being blue. And this is us.",1900-01-01 00:47:54,basically story brain writing written word written perceptual content basically multimedia content model person would feel existed virtual person happen virtual person virtual person get access language center talk sky blue u
174,Lex Fridman, But hold on a second. Do I exist in your simulation?,1900-01-01 00:48:18,hold second exist simulation
175,Joscha Bach," You do exist, in an almost similar way as me. So there are internal states that are less accessible for me that you have and so on, and my model might not be completely adequate. There are also things that I might perceive about you that you don't perceive. But in some sense, both you and me are some puppets, two puppets that enact this play in my mind. And I identify with one of them because I can control one of the puppet directly. And with the other one I can create things in between. So, for instance, we can go in and interact and that even leads to a coupling, to a feedback loop, so we can think things together in a certain way or feel things together. But this coupling is itself not a physical phenomenon, is entirely a software phenomenon. It's the result of two different implementations interacting with each other.",1900-01-01 00:48:23,exist almost similar way internal state le accessible model might completely adequate also thing might perceive perceive sense puppet two puppet enact play mind identify one control one puppet directly one create thing instance go interact even lead coupling feedback loop think thing together certain way feel thing together coupling physical phenomenon entirely software phenomenon result two different implementation interacting
176,Lex Fridman," So that's interesting. So are you suggesting ...I'd... Like the way you think about it... Is the entirety of existence a simulation and we're kind of each mind is a little sub-simulation? That like, why don't you, why doesn't your mind have access to my mind's full state? Like... For the same reason that my mind doesn't have access to its own full state... So what?I mean,",1900-01-01 00:49:11,interesting suggesting like way think entirety existence simulation kind mind little sub simulation like mind access mind full state like reason mind access full state mean
177,Joscha Bach," there is no trick involved. So basically, when I know something about myself, it's because I made a model. So one part of your brain is tasked with modeling what other parts of your brain are doing.",1900-01-01 00:49:43,trick involved basically know something made model one part brain tasked modeling part brain
178,Lex Fridman," Yes, but there seems to be an incredible consistency about this world in the physical sense that is repeatable experiments and so on. Yeah. How does that fit in to our silly the center of a apes simulation of the world? So why is it so why is everything so repeatable and not everything? There's a lot of fundamental physics experiments that are repeatable...",1900-01-01 00:49:52,yes seems incredible consistency world physical sense repeatable experiment yeah fit silly center ape simulation world everything repeatable everything lot fundamental physic experiment repeatable
179,Lex Fridman," for a long time, all over the place and so on. Laws of physics, how does that fit in you think?",1900-01-01 00:50:16,long time place law physic fit think
180,Joscha Bach," It seems that parts of the world that are not deterministic are not long lived. So if you build a system, any kind of automaton, so if you build simulations of something, you'll notice that the phenomena that endure are those that give rise to stable dynamics. So basically, if you see anything that is complex in the world, it's the result usually of some control of some feedback that keeps it stable around certain attractors. And the things that are not stable, that don't give rise to certain harmonic patterns and so on, they tend to get weeded out over time.",1900-01-01 00:50:21,seems part world deterministic long lived build system kind automaton build simulation something notice phenomenon endure give rise stable dynamic basically see anything complex world result usually control feedback keep stable around certain attractor thing stable give rise certain harmonic pattern tend get weeded time
181,Joscha Bach," So if we are in a region of the universe that sustains complexity, which is required to implement minds like ours, this is going to be a region of the universe that is very tightly controlled and controllable. So it's going to have lots of interesting symmetries and also symmetry breaks that allow the creation of structure.",1900-01-01 00:50:55,region universe sustains complexity required implement mind like going region universe tightly controlled controllable going lot interesting symmetry also symmetry break allow creation structure
182,Joscha Bach, But they exist where so there's such an interesting idea that mind is stimulation that's constructing the narrative. My question is just to try to understand how that fits with this with the entirety of the universe.,1900-01-01 00:51:17,exist interesting idea mind stimulation constructing narrative question try understand fit entirety universe
183,Joscha Bach, You're saying that there's a region of this universe that allows enough complexity to create creatures like us.,1900-01-01 00:51:32,saying region universe allows enough complexity create creature like u
184,Joscha Bach," But what's the connection between the the brain, the mind and the broader universe which comes first, which is more fundamental?",1900-01-01 00:51:37,connection brain mind broader universe come first fundamental
185,Joscha Bach, Is the is the mind a starting point? The universe is emergent. Is the universe the starting point? The minds are emergent.,1900-01-01 00:51:47,mind starting point universe emergent universe starting point mind emergent
186,Joscha Bach," Um, I think quite clearly the latter. It's at least a much easier explanation because it allows us to make causal models and I don't see any way to construct an inverse causality.",1900-01-01 00:51:53,um think quite clearly latter least much easier explanation allows u make causal model see way construct inverse causality
187,Lex Fridman, So what happens when you die to your mind simulation?,1900-01-01 00:52:04,happens die mind simulation
188,Joscha Bach," Um, my implementation ceases. So basically the thing that implements my self will no longer be present, which means -if I am not implemented on the minds of other people- the thing that I identify with. The weird thing is: I don't actually have an identity beyond the identity that I construct. If I was the Dalai Lama, he identifies as a form of government. So basically the Dalai Lama gets reborn, not because he is confused, but because he is not identifying as a human being.",1900-01-01 00:52:07,um implementation cease basically thing implement self longer present mean implemented mind people thing identify weird thing actually identity beyond identity construct dalai lama identifies form government basically dalai lama get reborn confused identifying human
189,Joscha Bach," He runs on a human being. He's basically a governmental software. Right. That is instantiated in every new generation anew. So his advisors will pick someone who does this in the next generation. So if you identify with this, you are no longer human and you don't die, in the sense that what dies is only the body of the human that you run on. To kill the Dalai Lama, you would have to kill his tradition. And if we look at ourselves, we realize that we are to a small part like this, most of us. So for instance, if you have children, you realize something lives on in them. Or if you spark an idea in the world, something lives on. Or if you identify with the society around you. Because you are a part that, you're not just this human being.",1900-01-01 00:52:38,run human basically governmental software right instantiated every new generation anew advisor pick someone next generation identify longer human die sense dy body human run kill dalai lama would kill tradition look realize small part like us instance child realize something life spark idea world something life identify society around part human
190,Joscha Bach, Yeah.,1900-01-01 00:53:18,yeah
191,Joscha Bach," So in a sense, you are kind of like a Dalai Lama in the sense that you, Joscha Bach , is just a collection of ideas like you have this operating system on, which is a bunch of ideas live and interact. And then once you die, there kind of, some of them jump off the ship...",1900-01-01 00:53:18,sense kind like dalai lama sense joscha bach collection idea like operating system bunch idea live interact die kind jump ship
192,Joscha Bach, You put it the other way. Identity is a software state. It's a construction. It's not physically real. Your identity is not a physical concept. It's basically a representation of different objects on the same world line.,1900-01-01 00:53:36,put way identity software state construction physically real identity physical concept basically representation different object world line
193,Joscha Bach, But identity...,1900-01-01 00:53:48,identity
194,Joscha Bach," lives and dies, are you attached? This is... What's the fundamental thing is that the ideas that come together to form identity or each individual identity actually are fundamental thing.",1900-01-01 00:53:51,life dy attached fundamental thing idea come together form identity individual identity actually fundamental thing
195,Joscha Bach, It's a representation that you can get agency over if you care. So basically you can choose what you identify with if you want to.,1900-01-01 00:54:03,representation get agency care basically choose identify want
196,Lex Fridman, But it just seems uh...,1900-01-01 00:54:10,seems uh
197,Lex Fridman," If if the mind is not real, it's not that the the birth and death is not a crucial part of it.",1900-01-01 00:54:12,mind real birth death crucial part
198,Lex Fridman," Well, maybe I'm silly. Maybe I'm attached to this whole biological organism.",1900-01-01 00:54:22,well maybe silly maybe attached whole biological organism
199,Lex Fridman," But it seems that the physical being, a physical object in this world is is an important aspect of birth and death. Like it feels like it has to be physical to die. It feels like simulations don't have to die.",1900-01-01 00:54:31,seems physical physical object world important aspect birth death like feel like physical die feel like simulation die
200,Joscha Bach," The physics that we experience is not the real physics. There is no color and sound in the real world. Color and sound are types of representations that you get if you want to model reality with oscillators. So colors and sound, in some sense, have octaves. and it's because they are represented properly with oscillators. Right. So that's why colors form a circle of hues. And colors have harmonics, sounds have harmonics as a result of synchronizing oscillators in the brain.",1900-01-01 00:54:46,physic experience real physic color sound real world color sound type representation get want model reality oscillator color sound sense octave represented properly oscillator right color form circle hue color harmonic sound harmonic result synchronizing oscillator brain
201,Joscha Bach," Right. So the world that we subjectively interact with is fundamentally the result of the representation mechanisms in our brain. They're mathematically, to some degree, universal. There are certain regularities that you can discover in the patterns and not others, but the patterns that we get, this is not the real world. The world that we interact with is always made of too many parts to count. Right? So when you look at this table and so on, it's consisting of so many molecules and atoms that you cannot count them.",1900-01-01 00:55:13,right world subjectively interact fundamentally result representation mechanism brain mathematically degree universal certain regularity discover pattern others pattern get real world world interact always made many part count right look table consisting many molecule atom cannot count
202,Joscha Bach," So you only look at the aggregate dynamics that limit dynamics. If you had almost infinitely many patterns of particles, what would be the dynamics of the table? And this is roughly what you get. So geometry that we're interacting with is the result of discovering those operators that work in the limit, that you get by building an infinite serious that converges. For those parts where it converges it's geometry, for those parts where it doesn't convergence it's chaos.",1900-01-01 00:55:40,look aggregate dynamic limit dynamic almost infinitely many pattern particle would dynamic table roughly get geometry interacting result discovering operator work limit get building infinite serious converges part converges geometry part convergence chaos
203,Lex Fridman," Right. And then so all of that is filtered through the sort of the consciousness that's emergent in our narrative, that the consciousness gives it color, gives a feeling, gives a flavor.",1900-01-01 00:56:05,right filtered sort consciousness emergent narrative consciousness give color give feeling give flavor
204,Joscha Bach," So I think the feeling, flavor and so on is given by the relationship that a feature has to all the other features. It's basically a giant relational graph that is our subjective universe. The color is given by those aspects of the representation or the experiential color where you care about where you have identifications.",1900-01-01 00:56:17,think feeling flavor given relationship feature feature basically giant relational graph subjective universe color given aspect representation experiential color care identification
205,Joscha Bach," Where something means something, where you are the inside of a feedback loop. And the dimensions of of caring are basically dimensions of this motivational system that we emerge over.",1900-01-01 00:56:37,something mean something inside feedback loop dimension caring basically dimension motivational system emerge
206,Lex Fridman," The the meaning of the relations, the graph...",1900-01-01 00:56:46,meaning relation graph
207,Lex Fridman, Can you elaborate on that a little bit? Like where does the maybe even step back and ask the question of what is consciousness to be sort of more systematic? Like what what what do you how do you think about consciousness?,1900-01-01 00:56:50,elaborate little bit like maybe even step back ask question consciousness sort systematic like think consciousness
208,Joscha Bach," I think that consciousness is largely a model of the contents of your attention. It's a mechanism that has evolved for a certain type of learning. At the moment, our machine learning systems largely work by building chains of weighted sums of real numbers for some non-linearity. And you learn by piping in error signals through these different chained layers and adjusting the weights and these weighted sums. And you can approximate the most polynoms with this if you have enough training data. But the price is, you need to change a lot of these weights.",1900-01-01 00:57:04,think consciousness largely model content attention mechanism evolved certain type learning moment machine learning system largely work building chain weighted sum real number non linearity learn piping error signal different chained layer adjusting weight weighted sum approximate polynoms enough training data price need change lot weight
209,Joscha Bach," Basically, the arrow is piped backwards into the system until it accumulates at certain junctures in the network and everything else evens out statistically. And only at this juncture, this is where you had the actual error in the network, you make the change there. This is a very slow process and our brains don't have enough time for that because we don't get old enough to play GO the way that our machines learn to play GO. So instead, what we do is an attention based learning.",1900-01-01 00:57:41,basically arrow piped backwards system accumulates certain juncture network everything else even statistically juncture actual error network make change slow process brain enough time get old enough play go way machine learn play go instead attention based learning
210,Joscha Bach," We pinpoint the probable region in the network where we can make an improvement, and then we store the this binding state together with the expected outcome in a protocol. And this ability to make indexed memories for the purpose of learning to revisit these commitments later. This requires a memory of the contents of our attention. Another aspect is when I construct my reality, I make mistakes. So I see things that turn out to be reflections or shadows and so on, which means I have to be able to point out which features of my perception gave rise to a present construction of reality.",1900-01-01 00:58:05,pinpoint probable region network make improvement store binding state together expected outcome protocol ability make indexed memory purpose learning revisit commitment later requires memory content attention another aspect construct reality make mistake see thing turn reflection shadow mean able point feature perception gave rise present construction reality
211,Joscha Bach," So the system needs to pay attention to the features that are currently in its focus. And it also needs to pay attention to whether it pays attention itself, in part because the attentional system gets trained with the same mechanism, so it's reflexive. But also in part because your attention lapses if you don't pay attention to the attention itself. Right? So is the thing that I'm currently seeing, just a dream that my brain has spun off into some kind of daydream? Or am I still paying attention to my percept?",1900-01-01 00:58:41,system need pay attention feature currently focus also need pay attention whether pay attention part attentional system get trained mechanism reflexive also part attention lapse pay attention attention right thing currently seeing dream brain spun kind daydream still paying attention percept
212,Joscha Bach," So you have to periodically go back and see whether you're still paying attention and if you have this loop and you make it tight enough between the system becoming aware of the contents of its attention and the fact that it's paying attention itself and makes attention the object of its attention, I think this is the loop over which we wake up.",1900-01-01 00:59:09,periodically go back see whether still paying attention loop make tight enough system becoming aware content attention fact paying attention make attention object attention think loop wake
213,Lex Fridman," So there's this... So there's this attentional mechanism that's somehow self-referential that's fundamental to our consciousnesses. So I'll just ask you a question. I don't know how much you're familiar with the recent breakthroughs in natural language processing. They use attentional mechanisms, use something called Transformer's to learn patterns and sentences by allowing the network to focus its attention to particular parts of the sentence and each individual. So like parametrised and make it learnable the dynamics of a sentence by having like a little window into the into the sentence.",1900-01-01 00:59:25,attentional mechanism somehow self referential fundamental consciousness ask question know much familiar recent breakthrough natural language processing use attentional mechanism use something called transformer learn pattern sentence allowing network focus attention particular part sentence individual like parametrised make learnable dynamic sentence like little window sentence
214,Lex Fridman," Do you think that's like a little step towards that adventure, which will take us to the intentional mechanisms from which consciousness can emerge?",1900-01-01 01:00:07,think like little step towards adventure take u intentional mechanism consciousness emerge
215,Joscha Bach," Not quite. I think it models only one aspect of attention. In the early days of automated language translation, there was an example that I find particularly funny where somebody tried to translate a text from English into German and it was a bat broke the window. And the translation in German was Eine Fledermaus zerbrach das Fenster mit einem Baseballschläger. So to translate back into English a bat, this flying mammal broke the window with a baseball bat.",1900-01-01 01:00:16,quite think model one aspect attention early day automated language translation example find particularly funny somebody tried translate text english german bat broke window translation german eine fledermaus zerbrach da fenster mit einem baseballschlger translate back english bat flying mammal broke window baseball bat
216,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:00:48,yes
217,Joscha Bach, And it seemed to be the most similar to this program because it somehow maximized the possibility of translating the concept bat into German in the same sentence.,1900-01-01 01:00:48,seemed similar program somehow maximized possibility translating concept bat german sentence
218,Joscha Bach, And this is a mistake that the transformer model is not doing because it's tracking identity. And the attentional mechanism in the transformer model is basically putting its finger on individual concepts and make sure that these concepts pop up later in the text.,1900-01-01 01:00:59,mistake transformer model tracking identity attentional mechanism transformer model basically putting finger individual concept make sure concept pop later text
219,Lex Fridman, Yeah.,1900-01-01 01:01:14,yeah
220,Joscha Bach," And tracks basically the individuals through the text. And it's why the system can learn things that other systems couldn't before it, which makes it, for instance, possible to write a text where it talks about a scientist and the scientist has a name and has a pronoun and it gets a consistent story about that thing.",1900-01-01 01:01:14,track basically individual text system learn thing system make instance possible write text talk scientist scientist name pronoun get consistent story thing
221,Joscha Bach," What it does not do, it doesn't fully integrate this. So its meaning falls apart at some point. It loses track of this context. It does not yet understand that everything that it says has to refer to the same universe. And this is where this thing falls apart. But the attention in the transformer model does not go beyond tracking identity. And tracking identity is an important part of attention, but it's a different, very specific attentional mechanism. And it's not the one that gives rise to the type of consciousness that we have.",1900-01-01 01:01:31,fully integrate meaning fall apart point loses track context yet understand everything say refer universe thing fall apart attention transformer model go beyond tracking identity tracking identity important part attention different specific attentional mechanism one give rise type consciousness
222,Lex Fridman," Just to linger on it, what do you mean by identity in the context of language?",1900-01-01 01:01:59,linger mean identity context language
223,Joscha Bach," So when you talk about language, you have different words that can refer to the same concept.",1900-01-01 01:02:03,talk language different word refer concept
224,Lex Fridman, Got it.,1900-01-01 01:02:09,got
225,Joscha Bach, And in the sense...,1900-01-01 01:02:09,sense
226,Lex Fridman, So space of concepts so..,1900-01-01 01:02:10,space concept
227,Joscha Bach," Yes. And it can also be in a nominal sense or in lexical sense that you say, this word does not only refer to this class of objects, but it refers to a definite object to some kind of agent that waves their way through the story and is only referred by different ways in the language. So the language is basically a projection from a conceptual representation, from a scene that is evolving into discrete string of symbols. And what a transformer is able to do, it learns aspects of this projection mechanism that other models couldn't learn.",1900-01-01 01:02:12,yes also nominal sense lexical sense say word refer class object refers definite object kind agent wave way story referred different way language language basically projection conceptual representation scene evolving discrete string symbol transformer able learns aspect projection mechanism model learn
228,Lex Fridman," So have you ever seen artificial intelligence or any kind of construction idea that allows for unlike neural networks or perhaps within neural networks, that's able to form something where the space of concepts continues to be integrated? So what you're describing... Building a knowledge base, building this consistent larger and larger set of ideas that would then allow for deeper understanding?",1900-01-01 01:02:49,ever seen artificial intelligence kind construction idea allows unlike neural network perhaps within neural network able form something space concept continues integrated describing building knowledge base building consistent larger larger set idea would allow deeper understanding
229,Joscha Bach," Wittgenstein thought that we can build everything from language, from basically a logical grammatical construct.",1900-01-01 01:03:15,wittgenstein thought build everything language basically logical grammatical construct
230,Joscha Bach," And I think to some degree, this was also what Minsky believed. So that's why he focused so much on common sense reasoning and so on. And a project that was inspired by him was Cyc, um, there was ...",1900-01-01 01:03:22,think degree also minsky believed focused much common sense reasoning project inspired cyc um
231,Lex Fridman, It's still going on.,1900-01-01 01:03:35,still going
232,Joscha Bach," Yes, of course. Ideas don't die. Only people die. And...",1900-01-01 01:03:36,yes course idea die people die
233,Lex Fridman," that's true, but uh...",1900-01-01 01:03:42,true uh
234,Joscha Bach," And Cyc is a productive project. It's just probably not one that is going to converge to general intelligence. The thing that Wittgenstein couldn't solve, and he looked at this in his book at the end of his life, Philosophical Investigations, was the notion of images.",1900-01-01 01:03:43,cyc productive project probably one going converge general intelligence thing wittgenstein solve looked book end life philosophical investigation notion image
235,Joscha Bach," So images play an important role in Tractatus, the Tractatus, an attempt to basically turn philosophy into logical probing language. To design a logical language in which you can do actual philosophy, that is rich enough for doing this. And the difficulty was to deal with perceptual content. And eventually I think he decided that he was not able to solve it. And I think this preempted the failure of the largest program in A.I. And the solution as we see it today is, we need more general functional approximation.",1900-01-01 01:03:58,image play important role tractatus tractatus attempt basically turn philosophy logical probing language design logical language actual philosophy rich enough difficulty deal perceptual content eventually think decided able solve think preempted failure largest program solution see today need general functional approximation
236,Joscha Bach," There are functions, geometric functions, that we learn to approximate, that cannot be efficiently expressed and computed in a grammatical language. We can, of course, build automata that go via number theory and so on to learn linear algebra and then compute an approximation of this geometry. But to equate language and geometry is not an efficient way to think about it.",1900-01-01 01:04:27,function geometric function learn approximate cannot efficiently expressed computed grammatical language course build automaton go via number theory learn linear algebra compute approximation geometry equate language geometry efficient way think
237,Lex Fridman, So functional... Where you kind of just said that neural networks are sort of the approach anyone always takes is actually more general than than what can be expressed through language.,1900-01-01 01:04:49,functional kind said neural network sort approach anyone always take actually general expressed language
238,Joscha Bach, Yes. So what can be efficiently expressed through language at the data rates at which we process grammatical language.,1900-01-01 01:05:01,yes efficiently expressed language data rate process grammatical language
239,Lex Fridman," OK, so you don't think... So... You don't think languages.... So you disagree with Wittgenstein that language is not fundamental to...",1900-01-01 01:05:09,ok think think language disagree wittgenstein language fundamental
240,Joscha Bach," I agree with Wittgenstein, I just agree with the late Wittgenstein. And I also agree with the beauty of the early Wittgenstein. I think that the Tractatus itself is probably the most beautiful philosophical text that was written in the 20th century.",1900-01-01 01:05:15,agree wittgenstein agree late wittgenstein also agree beauty early wittgenstein think tractatus probably beautiful philosophical text written century
241,Lex Fridman," But but language is not fundamental to cognition, intelligence and consciousness.",1900-01-01 01:05:30,language fundamental cognition intelligence consciousness
242,Joscha Bach," So I think that language is a particular way or the natural language that we are using at a particular level of abstraction that we use to communicate with each other. But the languages in which we express geometry are not grammatical languages in the same sense. So they work slightly different, they're more general expressions of functions. And I think the general nature of a model is, you have a bunch of parameters, these are... have arranged, these are the variances of the world. And you have relationships between them, which are constraints which say if certain parameters have these values, then other parameters have to have the following values.",1900-01-01 01:05:35,think language particular way natural language using particular level abstraction use communicate language express geometry grammatical language sense work slightly different general expression function think general nature model bunch parameter arranged variance world relationship constraint say certain parameter value parameter following value
243,Joscha Bach," And this is a very early insight in computer science. And I think the some of the earliest formulations is the Boltzmann machine. And the problem with the Boltzmann machine is that it has a measure of whether it's good, its basically the energy on the system, the amount of tension that you have left in the constraints where the constraints don't quite match.",1900-01-01 01:06:12,early insight computer science think earliest formulation boltzmann machine problem boltzmann machine measure whether good basically energy system amount tension left constraint constraint quite match
244,Joscha Bach," And it's very difficult to -despite having this global measure- to train it. Because as soon as you add more than trivially a few elements, parameters into the system, it's very difficult to get it settled in the right architecture. And so the solution that Hinton and Sejnowski found was to use a restricted Boltzmann machine which uses the hidden links, the internal links in the Boltzmann machine, and only has the based input and output layer. But there's limits the expressivity of the Boltzmann machines.",1900-01-01 01:06:29,difficult despite global measure train soon add trivially element parameter system difficult get settled right architecture solution hinton sejnowski found use restricted boltzmann machine us hidden link internal link boltzmann machine based input output layer limit expressivity boltzmann machine
245,Joscha Bach," So now he built a network of small of these primitive Boltzmann machines. And in some sense you can see almost continuous development from this to the deep learning models that we are using today. Even though we don't use Boltzmann machines at this point. But the idea of the machine is you take this model, you clamp some of the values to perception, and this forces the entire machine to go into a state that is compatible with the states that you currently perceive and this state is your model of the world.",1900-01-01 01:07:01,built network small primitive boltzmann machine sense see almost continuous development deep learning model using today even though use boltzmann machine point idea machine take model clamp value perception force entire machine go state compatible state currently perceive state model world
246,Joscha Bach," I think it's a very general way of thinking about models, but we have to use a different approach to make it work. And this is: we have to find different networks that train the Boltzmann machine. So the mechanism that trains the Boltzmann machine and the mechanism that makes the bottom machine settle into its state are distinct from the constrained architecture of the Boltzmann machine itself.",1900-01-01 01:07:27,think general way thinking model use different approach make work find different network train boltzmann machine mechanism train boltzmann machine mechanism make bottom machine settle state distinct constrained architecture boltzmann machine
247,Lex Fridman, That's the kind of mechanism that we want to develop. You're saying?,1900-01-01 01:07:50,kind mechanism want develop saying
248,Joscha Bach," Yes. So that's the direction in which I think our research is going to go. It's going to, for instance, what you notice in perception is: our perceptional models of the world are not probabilistic, but possiballistic, which means you should be able to perceive things that are improbable but possible. Right? Perceptual state is valid, not if it's probable, but if it's possible, if it's coherent.",1900-01-01 01:07:53,yes direction think research going go going instance notice perception perceptional model world probabilistic possiballistic mean able perceive thing improbable possible right perceptual state valid probable possible coherent
249,Lex Fridman, Yeah.,1900-01-01 01:08:16,yeah
250,Joscha Bach," So if you see a tiger coming after you, you should be able to see this, even if it's unlikely.",1900-01-01 01:08:17,see tiger coming able see even unlikely
251,Joscha Bach," And the probability is necessary for convergence of the models. So given the state of possibilities that is very, very large and a set of perceptual features, how should you change the state of states of the model to get it to converge with your perception?",1900-01-01 01:08:22,probability necessary convergence model given state possibility large set perceptual feature change state state model get converge perception
252,Lex Fridman," Uh, but the the space of the space of ideas that are coherent with the context that you're sensing is perhaps not as large. I mean, that that's perhaps a pretty small.",1900-01-01 01:08:37,uh space space idea coherent context sensing perhaps large mean perhaps pretty small
253,Joscha Bach," The degree of coherence that you need to achieve, depends, of course, how deep your model go. That is, for instance, politics is very simple when you know very little about game theory and human nature. So the younger you are, the more obvious this is how politics would work, right?",1900-01-01 01:08:50,degree coherence need achieve depends course deep model go instance politics simple know little game theory human nature younger obvious politics would work right
254,Joscha Bach, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:09:06,yes
255,Joscha Bach," And because you get a coherent aesthetics for relatively few inputs. And the more layers you model, the more layers you model reality, the harder it gets to satisfy all the constraints.",1900-01-01 01:09:06,get coherent aesthetic relatively input layer model layer model reality harder get satisfy constraint
256,Lex Fridman," So, you know, the current neural networks are fundamentally supervised learning system with a feed forward neural network is back propagation to learn. What's your intuition about what kind of mechanisms might we move towards to improve the learning procedure?",1900-01-01 01:09:18,know current neural network fundamentally supervised learning system feed forward neural network back propagation learn intuition kind mechanism might move towards improve learning procedure
257,Joscha Bach," I think one big aspect is going to be meta-learning and architecture search starts in this direction. In some sense, the first wave of AI, classical AI, work by identifying a problem and a possible solution and implementing the solution, program that plays chess. And right now, we're in the second wave of A.I. So instead of writing the algorithm that implements this solution, we write an algorithm that automatically searches for an algorithm that implements the solution. So the learning system, in some sense, is an algorithm that itself discovers the algorithm that solves the problem, like Go.",1900-01-01 01:09:35,think one big aspect going meta learning architecture search start direction sense first wave ai classical ai work identifying problem possible solution implementing solution program play chess right second wave instead writing algorithm implement solution write algorithm automatically search algorithm implement solution learning system sense algorithm discovers algorithm solves problem like go
258,Joscha Bach, Go is too hard to implement the solution by hand. But we can implement an algorithm that finds the solution.,1900-01-01 01:10:07,go hard implement solution hand implement algorithm find solution
259,Joscha Bach," So now let's move to the third stage, right. The third stage would be meta-learning. Find an algorithm that discovers a learning algorithm for the given domain. Our brain is probably not a learning system, but the meta-learning system. This is one way of looking at what we are doing. There is another way, if you look at the way our brain is, for instance, implemented: there is no central control that tells all the neurons how to wire up.",1900-01-01 01:10:13,let move third stage right third stage would meta learning find algorithm discovers learning algorithm given domain brain probably learning system meta learning system one way looking another way look way brain instance implemented central control tell neuron wire
260,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:10:35,yes
261,Joscha Bach," Instead, every neuron is an individual reinforcement learning agent. Every neuron is a single-celled organism that is quite complicated and in some sense quite motivated to get fed. And it gets fed if it fires on average at the right time.",1900-01-01 01:10:36,instead every neuron individual reinforcement learning agent every neuron single celled organism quite complicated sense quite motivated get fed get fed fire average right time
262,Joscha Bach, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:10:49,yes
263,Joscha Bach," And the the right time depends on the context that the neuron exists in, which is the electrical and chemical environment that it has. So it basically has to learn a function over its environment that tells us when to fire, to get fed. Or if you see it as a reinforcement learning agent, every neuron is in some sense making a hypothesis when it sends a signal and tries to pipe a signal through the universe and tries to get a positive feedback for it.",1900-01-01 01:10:49,right time depends context neuron exists electrical chemical environment basically learn function environment tell u fire get fed see reinforcement learning agent every neuron sense making hypothesis sends signal try pipe signal universe try get positive feedback
264,Joscha Bach," And the entire thing is set up in such a way that it's robustly self-organizing into a brain. Which means you start out with different neuron types that have different priors on which hypothesis to test and how to get its reward, and you put them into different concentrations in a certain spatial alignment, and then you entrain it in a particular order. And as a result, you get the organized brain.",1900-01-01 01:11:15,entire thing set way robustly self organizing brain mean start different neuron type different prior hypothesis test get reward put different concentration certain spatial alignment entrain particular order result get organized brain
265,Lex Fridman," Yeah. So, OK, so the brain is a meta-learning system with a bunch of reinforcement learning agents and what I think you said but just to clarify, where do the... There's no centralized government that tells you here's a lost function, here's a lost function, here's a lost function. Like what? Who is... Who says what's the objective ... ?",1900-01-01 01:11:38,yeah ok brain meta learning system bunch reinforcement learning agent think said clarify centralized government tell lost function lost function lost function like say objective
266,Joscha Bach," There are also governments which impose loss functions on different parts of the brain, so we have differential attention. Some areas in your brain get especially rewarded when you look at faces. If you don't have that, you will get prosopagnosia, which basically means the inability to tell people apart by their faces. So ...",1900-01-01 01:12:05,also government impose loss function different part brain differential attention area brain get especially rewarded look face get prosopagnosia basically mean inability tell people apart face
267,Lex Fridman," And the reason that happens is because there was a... It had an evolutionary advantage, so like evolution comes into play here about it.",1900-01-01 01:12:22,reason happens evolutionary advantage like evolution come play
268,Joscha Bach," Yeah. It's basically an extraordinary attention that we have for faces. I don't think that people with prosopagnosia have per se a defective brain, the brain just has an average attention for faces. So people with prosopagnosia don't look at faces more than they look at cups. So the level at which they resolve the geometry of faces is not higher than the one than that for cups. And people that don't have prosopagnosia look obsessively at faces. Right?",1900-01-01 01:12:28,yeah basically extraordinary attention face think people prosopagnosia per se defective brain brain average attention face people prosopagnosia look face look cup level resolve geometry face higher one cup people prosopagnosia look obsessively face right
269,Joscha Bach," For you and me, it's impossible to move through a crowd without scanning the faces.",1900-01-01 01:12:52,impossible move crowd without scanning face
270,Joscha Bach," And as a result, we make insanely detailed models of faces that allow us to discern mental states of people.",1900-01-01 01:12:57,result make insanely detailed model face allow u discern mental state people
271,Lex Fridman," So obviously we don't know 99 percent of the details of this meta-learning system thats our mind, OK, but still, we took a leap from something much dumber to that from through the evolutionary process. Can you, first of all, maybe say how hard... How big of a leap is that from our brain, from our ape ancestors to multi-cell organisms? And is there something we can think about, about as we start to think about how to engineer intelligence?",1900-01-01 01:13:02,obviously know percent detail meta learning system thats mind ok still took leap something much dumber evolutionary process first maybe say hard big leap brain ape ancestor multi cell organism something think start think engineer intelligence
272,Lex Fridman, Is there something we can learn from evolution?,1900-01-01 01:13:38,something learn evolution
273,Joscha Bach," In some sense, life exists because of the market opportunity of controlled chemical reactions. You compete with dumb chemical reactions and we win in some areas against the dumb combustion because we can harness those entropy gradients, but you need to add a little bit of energy in a specific way to harvest more energy.",1900-01-01 01:13:41,sense life exists market opportunity controlled chemical reaction compete dumb chemical reaction win area dumb combustion harness entropy gradient need add little bit energy specific way harvest energy
274,Lex Fridman, So we outcompeted combustion.,1900-01-01 01:14:00,outcompeted combustion
275,Joscha Bach," Yes in many regions we do. And we try very hard because when we are in direct competition, we lose, right?",1900-01-01 01:14:01,yes many region try hard direct competition lose right
276,Lex Fridman, Yeah.,1900-01-01 01:14:07,yeah
277,Joscha Bach, So because the combustion is going to close the entropy gradients much faster than we can run.,1900-01-01 01:14:07,combustion going close entropy gradient much faster run
278,Lex Fridman," Yes, you got it. That's quite so Apollinaire. Yeah.",1900-01-01 01:14:13,yes got quite apollinaire yeah
279,Joscha Bach, Yeah. So basically we do this because every cell has a Turing machine built into it. It's like literally a read/write head on the tape.,1900-01-01 01:14:17,yeah basically every cell turing machine built like literally read write head tape
280,Joscha Bach," And so everything that's more complicated than a molecule that just is a vortex around attractors, that needs a Turing machine it for its regulation. And then you binds us together and you get next level organizational organism where the cells together implement some kind of software. And for me, a very interesting discovery in the last year was the word spirit, because I realized that what spirit actually means, is an operating system for an autonomous robot. And when the word was invented, people needed this word, but they didn't have robots that they built themselves.",1900-01-01 01:14:25,everything complicated molecule vortex around attractor need turing machine regulation bind u together get next level organizational organism cell together implement kind software interesting discovery last year word spirit realized spirit actually mean operating system autonomous robot word invented people needed word robot built
281,Joscha Bach," Yet the only autonomous robots that were known were people, animals, plants, ecosystems, cities and so on. And they all had spirits. And it makes sense to say that the plant has an operating system, right? If you pinch the plant in one area, then there's going to have repercussions throughout the plant. Everything in the plant is in some sense connected into some global aesthetics, like in other organisms. An organism is not a collection of cells, is a function that tells cells how to behave.",1900-01-01 01:14:59,yet autonomous robot known people animal plant ecosystem city spirit make sense say plant operating system right pinch plant one area going repercussion throughout plant everything plant sense connected global aesthetic like organism organism collection cell function tell cell behave
282,Joscha Bach," And this function is not implemented as some kind of supernatural thing, like some morphogenetic field. It is an emergent result of the interactions of each cell with other cells. Right?",1900-01-01 01:15:25,function implemented kind supernatural thing like morphogenetic field emergent result interaction cell cell right
283,Lex Fridman," Oh my god. So what you're saying is the organism is a function that tells what's what what the cells, cells, what to do. And the function is an emerg... Emerges from the interaction of the cells.",1900-01-01 01:15:37,oh god saying organism function tell cell cell function emerg emerges interaction cell
284,Joscha Bach, Yes. So it's basically a description of what the plant is doing in terms of microstates.,1900-01-01 01:15:53,yes basically description plant term microstates
285,Lex Fridman, Yeah.,1900-01-01 01:16:00,yeah
286,Joscha Bach," And the microstates, the physical implementation are too many of them to describe them. So the software that we use to describe what the plant is doing, the spirit of the plant, is the software, the operating system of the plant. Right? This is a way in which we, the observers, make sense of the plant.",1900-01-01 01:16:00,microstates physical implementation many describe software use describe plant spirit plant software operating system plant right way observer make sense plant
287,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:16:17,yes
288,Joscha Bach," And the same is true for people. So people have spirits, which is their operating system, in a way, right? And there's aspects of that operating system that relate to how your body functions and others, how you socially interact, how you interact with yourself and so on. And we make models of that spirit. And we think it's a loaded term because it's from a pre-scientific age. But we... it took the scientific age a long time to rediscover a term that is pretty much the same thing. And I suspect that the difference is that we still see between the old world and the new world are translation errors that travelled over the centuries.",1900-01-01 01:16:18,true people people spirit operating system way right aspect operating system relate body function others socially interact interact make model spirit think loaded term pre scientific age took scientific age long time rediscover term pretty much thing suspect difference still see old world new world translation error travelled century
289,Lex Fridman," But can you actually linger on that they why do you say thats, Spirit? Just to clarify, because I'm a little bit confused. So the... that the word spirit is a powerful thing. Why did you say in the last year or so that you discovered this? Do you mean the same old traditional idea of a spirit or do you mean...",1900-01-01 01:16:52,actually linger say thats spirit clarify little bit confused word spirit powerful thing say last year discovered mean old traditional idea spirit mean
290,Joscha Bach," I try to find out what people mean by spirit. When people say spirituality in the U.S., it usually refers to the phantom limb that they develop in the absence of culture. And a culture is in some sense, you could say, the spirit of a society that is long game. The thing that becomes self-aware at a level above the individuals where you say: if you don't do the following things, then the grand-grand-grandgrandchildren of our children will have nothing to eat.",1900-01-01 01:17:08,try find people mean spirit people say spirituality u usually refers phantom limb develop absence culture culture sense could say spirit society long game thing becomes self aware level individual say following thing grand grand grandgrandchildren child nothing eat
291,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:17:34,yes
292,Joscha Bach," So if you take this long scope, you try to maximize the length of the game that you are playing as a species, you realize that you are part of a larger thing that you cannot fully control, you probably need to submit to the ecosphere instead of trying to completely control it. Right? There needs to be a certain level at which we can exist as a species if we want to endure. And our culture is not sustaining this anymore.",1900-01-01 01:17:35,take long scope try maximize length game playing specie realize part larger thing cannot fully control probably need submit ecosphere instead trying completely control right need certain level exist specie want endure culture sustaining anymore
293,Joscha Bach," We basically made this bet with the Industrial Revolution that we can control everything. And the modernist societies with basically untethered growth led to a situation in which we depend on the ability to control the entire planet. And since we are not able to do that, as it seems, this culture will die. We realize that it doesn't have a future, right? We called our children Generation Z. Its not a very optimistic thing to do.",1900-01-01 01:17:59,basically made bet industrial revolution control everything modernist society basically untethered growth led situation depend ability control entire planet since able seems culture die realize future right called child generation z optimistic thing
294,Joscha Bach," Yeah. So you can have this kind of intuition that our civilization you said culture, but you really mean this...",1900-01-01 01:18:27,yeah kind intuition civilization said culture really mean
295,Lex Fridman," the spirit of the civilization... the entirety of this civilization may not exist for long. Yeah. So whats you... Can you can untangle that. What's your intuition behind that? So you kind of offline-mentioned to me that the Industrial Revolution was kind of the moment we agreed to accept the offer, sign on the paper, on the dotted line with the Industrial Revolution, we doomed ourselves. Can you elaborate on that?",1900-01-01 01:18:35,spirit civilization entirety civilization may exist long yeah whats untangle intuition behind kind offline mentioned industrial revolution kind moment agreed accept offer sign paper dotted line industrial revolution doomed elaborate
296,Joscha Bach," This is a suspicion, I, of course, don't know how it plays out.",1900-01-01 01:19:03,suspicion course know play
297,Joscha Bach," Of course, of course...",1900-01-01 01:19:06,course course
298,Joscha Bach," But It seems to me that, in a society in which you leverage yourself very far over an entropic abyss without land on the other side, it's relatively clear that you're cantilever is at some point going to break down into this entropic abyss, and you have to pay the bill.",1900-01-01 01:19:07,seems society leverage far entropic abyss without land side relatively clear cantilever point going break entropic abyss pay bill
299,Joscha Bach, OK. Russia is my first language and I'm also an idiot.,1900-01-01 01:19:24,ok russia first language also idiot
300,Joscha Bach, Me too.,1900-01-01 01:19:29,
301,Joscha Bach," This is just two apes. instead of playing with a banana, trying to have fun by talking. OK, anthropic what and what's anthropic?",1900-01-01 01:19:32,two ape instead playing banana trying fun talking ok anthropic anthropic
302,Joscha Bach, Entropic...,1900-01-01 01:19:43,entropic
303,Joscha Bach, And tropic...,1900-01-01 01:19:44,tropic
304,Joscha Bach, And... So entropic in the sense of entropy...,1900-01-01 01:19:44,entropic sense entropy
305,Joscha Bach," Oh entropic, got it. and... Entropic, so what was the other word you used...",1900-01-01 01:19:47,oh entropic got entropic word used
306,Joscha Bach, Abyss...,1900-01-01 01:19:50,abyss
307,Lex Fridman, Whats that?,1900-01-01 01:19:52,whats
308,Joscha Bach, It's a big gorge.,1900-01-01 01:19:52,big gorge
309,Lex Fridman, Oh abyss...,1900-01-01 01:19:54,oh abyss
310,Joscha Bach," Abyss, yes.",1900-01-01 01:19:55,abyss yes
311,Lex Fridman, Enthropic Abyss! So many of the things you say are poetic. It's kind of...,1900-01-01 01:19:56,enthropic abyss many thing say poetic kind
312,Joscha Bach," and also mispronounced, it's amazing, right?",1900-01-01 01:19:59,also mispronounced amazing right
313,Lex Fridman," It's mispronounced. Which... Which makes it even more poetic. Wittgenstein would be proud. So entropic abyss. OK, let's let's rewind then. The Industrial Revolution. So how does that get us into the entropic abyss?",1900-01-01 01:20:01,mispronounced make even poetic wittgenstein would proud entropic abyss ok let let rewind industrial revolution get u entropic abyss
314,Joscha Bach," So in some sense, we burned 100 million years worth of trees to get everybody plumping.",1900-01-01 01:20:21,sense burned million year worth tree get everybody plumping
315,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:20:27,yes
316,Joscha Bach," And the society that we had before that had a very limited number of people. So basically, since 0 BC, we hovered between 300 and 400 million people.",1900-01-01 01:20:27,society limited number people basically since bc hovered million people
317,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:20:38,yes
318,Joscha Bach," And this only changed with the Enlightenment and the subsequent industrial revolution and in some sense, the Enlightenment freed our rationality and also freed our norms from the pre-existing order gradually. It was a process that basically happened in feedback loops so it was not that just one caused the other, it was a dynamic that started. And the dynamic worked by basically increasing productivity to such a degree that we could feed all of our children. And I think the definition of poverty is that you have as many children as you can feed before they die. Which is in some sense the state that all animals on Earth are in.",1900-01-01 01:20:38,changed enlightenment subsequent industrial revolution sense enlightenment freed rationality also freed norm pre existing order gradually process basically happened feedback loop one caused dynamic started dynamic worked basically increasing productivity degree could feed child think definition poverty many child feed die sense state animal earth
319,Lex Fridman, The definition of poverty is having enough...,1900-01-01 01:21:20,definition poverty enough
320,Joscha Bach," So you can have only so many children as you can feed and if you have more, they die.",1900-01-01 01:21:22,many child feed die
321,Joscha Bach, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:21:26,yes
322,Joscha Bach," And in our societies, you can basically have as many children as you want and they don't die.",1900-01-01 01:21:27,society basically many child want die
323,Lex Fridman, Right.,1900-01-01 01:21:32,right
324,Joscha Bach," So the reason why we don't have as many children as we want is because we also have to pay a price in terms of, we have to insert ourselves in a lower social tritonus if we have too many. So basically, everybody in the under, middle and lower upper class has only a limited number of children because having more of them would mean a big economic hit to the individual families.",1900-01-01 01:21:33,reason many child want also pay price term insert lower social tritonus many basically everybody middle lower upper class limited number child would mean big economic hit individual family
325,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:21:54,yes
326,Joscha Bach," Because children, especially in the U.S., are super expensive to have. And you only are taken out of this if you are basically super rich or if you are super poor. If you are super poor, it doesn't matter how many kids you have because your status is not going to change. And these children are largely not going to die of hunger.",1900-01-01 01:21:54,child especially u super expensive taken basically super rich super poor super poor matter many kid status going change child largely going die hunger
327,Lex Fridman, So how does this lead us to self-destruction? So there's a lot of unpleasant properties about this process.,1900-01-01 01:22:11,lead u self destruction lot unpleasant property process
328,Joscha Bach," So basically what we try to do is we try to let our children survive even if they have diseases. Like, I would have died before my mid 20s without modern medicine and most of my friends would have, as well. So many of us wouldn't live without the advantages of modern medicine and modern industrialised society. We get our protein largely by subduing the entirety of nature.",1900-01-01 01:22:16,basically try try let child survive even disease like would died mid without modern medicine friend would well many u live without advantage modern medicine modern industrialised society get protein largely subduing entirety nature
329,Joscha Bach," Now, imagine there would be some very clever microbe that would live in our organisms and would completely harvest them and change them into a thing that is necessary to sustain itself. And it would discover that, for instance, brain cells are kind of edible, but they're not quite nice. So you need to have more fat in them and you turn them into more fat cells. And basically this big organism would become a vegetable that is barely alive and it's going to be very brittle and not resilient when the environment changes.",1900-01-01 01:22:44,imagine would clever microbe would live organism would completely harvest change thing necessary sustain would discover instance brain cell kind edible quite nice need fat turn fat cell basically big organism would become vegetable barely alive going brittle resilient environment change
330,Lex Fridman," Yeah, but the...the... Some part of that organism, the one that's actually doing all the using of the... there will still be somebody thriving.",1900-01-01 01:23:13,yeah part organism one actually using still somebody thriving
331,Joscha Bach," So it relates back to this original question. I suspect that we are not the smartest thing on this planet. I suspect that basically every complex system has to have some complex regulation, if it depends on feedback loops. And so, for instance, it's likely that we should ascribe a certain degree of intelligence to plants. The problem is that plants don't have a nervous system, so they don't have a way to telegraph messages over large distances almost instantly in the plant.",1900-01-01 01:23:22,relates back original question suspect smartest thing planet suspect basically every complex system complex regulation depends feedback loop instance likely ascribe certain degree intelligence plant problem plant nervous system way telegraph message large distance almost instantly plant
332,Joscha Bach," And instead they will rely on chemicals between adjacent cells, which means the signal processing speed depends on the signal processing with the rate of a few millimeters per second. And as a result, if the plant is intelligent, it's not going to be intelligent at similar timescales as us.",1900-01-01 01:23:52,instead rely chemical adjacent cell mean signal processing speed depends signal processing rate millimeter per second result plant intelligent going intelligent similar timescales u
333,Lex Fridman," Yeah, brilliantly put. So the timescales is different. So you suspect we might not be the most intelligent, but we're... We're the most intelligent in this [...]scale... In our timescale.",1900-01-01 01:24:10,yeah brilliantly put timescales different suspect might intelligent intelligent scale timescale
334,Joscha Bach," So basically, if you would zoom out very far, you might discover that there have been intelligent ecosystems on the planet that existed for thousands of years in an almost undisturbed state. And it could be that these ecosystems activity related their environments. So basically changed the course of the evolution within this ecosystem to make it more efficient and as brittle.",1900-01-01 01:24:21,basically would zoom far might discover intelligent ecosystem planet existed thousand year almost undisturbed state could ecosystem activity related environment basically changed course evolution within ecosystem make efficient brittle
335,Lex Fridman," So its possible that something like plants is actually a set of living organisms, an ecosystem of living organisms that are just operating in a different timescale and are far superior in intelligent as human beings. And then human beings will die out and plants will still be there and they'll be there.",1900-01-01 01:24:42,possible something like plant actually set living organism ecosystem living organism operating different timescale far superior intelligent human being human being die plant still
336,Joscha Bach," Yeah, they also... There is an evolutionary adaptation playing a role at all of these levels. For instance, if mice don't get enough food and get stressed, the next generation of mice will be more sparse and more scrawny. And the reason for this is: because the ...In a natural environment the mice have probably hit a drought or something else. And if they're overgraze, then all the things that sustain them might go extinct and there will be no mice a few generations from now.",1900-01-01 01:24:58,yeah also evolutionary adaptation playing role level instance mouse get enough food get stressed next generation mouse sparse scrawny reason natural environment mouse probably hit drought something else overgraze thing sustain might go extinct mouse generation
337,Joscha Bach," So to make sure that there will be mice in five generations from now, basically the mice scale back. And a similar thing happens with the predators of mice. They should make sure that the mice don't completely go extinct. So in some sense, if the predators are smart enough, they will be tasked with shepherding their food supply.",1900-01-01 01:25:24,make sure mouse five generation basically mouse scale back similar thing happens predator mouse make sure mouse completely go extinct sense predator smart enough tasked shepherding food supply
338,Joscha Bach, And maybe the reason why lions have much larger brains than antelopes is not so much because it's so hard to catch an antelope as opposed to run away from the lion. But the lions need to make complex models of their environment. More complex than the antelopes.,1900-01-01 01:25:43,maybe reason lion much larger brain antelope much hard catch antelope opposed run away lion lion need make complex model environment complex antelope
339,Lex Fridman," So first of all, just describing that there's a bunch of complex systems and human beings may not even be the most special or intelligent of those complex systems, even on Earth, makes me feel a little better about the extinction of human species that we're talking about.",1900-01-01 01:25:57,first describing bunch complex system human being may even special intelligent complex system even earth make feel little better extinction human specie talking
340,Joscha Bach," Yes, Maybe we are just Gaia's ploy to put the carbon back into the atmosphere.",1900-01-01 01:26:10,yes maybe gaia ploy put carbon back atmosphere
341,Lex Fridman, This is just a nice... we tried it out...,1900-01-01 01:26:14,nice tried
342,Joscha Bach," The big stain on evolution is not us, it was trees.",1900-01-01 01:26:16,big stain evolution u tree
343,Joscha Bach, Earth evolved trees before they could be digested again. Right? There were no insects that could break all of them apart. Cellulose is so robust that you cannot get all of it with microorganisms. So many of these trees fell into swamps and all this carbon became inert and could no longer be recycled into organisms. And we are the species that is destined to take care of that.,1900-01-01 01:26:20,earth evolved tree could digested right insect could break apart cellulose robust cannot get microorganism many tree fell swamp carbon became inert could longer recycled organism specie destined take care
344,Lex Fridman, So this is kind of...,1900-01-01 01:26:40,kind
345,Joscha Bach," Dig it out of the ground, put it back into the atmosphere and the earth is already greening. So within a million years or so when the ecosystems have recovered from the rapid changes that they're not compatible with right now, the earth is going to be awesome again.",1900-01-01 01:26:42,dig ground put back atmosphere earth already greening within million year ecosystem recovered rapid change compatible right earth going awesome
346,Lex Fridman," And there won't be even a memory of us, of us little apes.",1900-01-01 01:26:55,even memory u u little ape
347,Joscha Bach," I think there will be memories of us. I suspect we are the first generally intelligent species in the sense. We are the first species with industrial society, because we will leave more phones than bones in the stratosphere.",1900-01-01 01:26:58,think memory u suspect first generally intelligent specie sense first specie industrial society leave phone bone stratosphere
348,Lex Fridman," .. well, see ...More phones than bones...I like it. But then let me push back. Uh... You've kind of suggested that we have a very narrow definition of... of intelli... I mean, why aren't trees more general ... A higher level of general intelligence?",1900-01-01 01:27:09,well see phone bone like let push back uh kind suggested narrow definition intelli mean tree general higher level general intelligence
349,Joscha Bach," If trees were intelligent then they would be at different time scales, which means within a hundred years, the tree is probably not going to make models that are as complex as the ones that we make in ten years.",1900-01-01 01:27:26,tree intelligent would different time scale mean within hundred year tree probably going make model complex one make ten year
350,Lex Fridman, But maybe the trees are the ones that made the phones right. Like like...,1900-01-01 01:27:36,maybe tree one made phone right like like
351,Joscha Bach," You could say, the entirety of life did it. You know, the first cell never died. The first cell only split. Right? And ever divided. And every cell in our body is still an instance of the first cell that split off from that very first cell. There was only one cell on this planet, as far as we know.",1900-01-01 01:27:42,could say entirety life know first cell never died first cell split right ever divided every cell body still instance first cell split first cell one cell planet far know
352,Lex Fridman, Yeah.,1900-01-01 01:27:57,yeah
353,Joscha Bach," And so the cell is not just the building block of life, it's a hyper-organism. Yeah, right. And we are part of this hyper-organism.",1900-01-01 01:27:57,cell building block life hyper organism yeah right part hyper organism
354,Joscha Bach," So nevertheless, this Hyper-organism. No, the.. This little particular branch of it, which is us humans, because the industrial revolution and maybe the exponential growth of technology might somehow destroy our cells. So what what do you think is the most likely way we might destroy our cells? So some people worry about genetic manipulation. Some people, as we've talked about, worry about either dumb artificial intelligence or super intelligent artificial intelligence destroying us. Some people worry, well... Nuclear weapons and weapons of war in general.",1900-01-01 01:28:06,nevertheless hyper organism little particular branch u human industrial revolution maybe exponential growth technology might somehow destroy cell think likely way might destroy cell people worry genetic manipulation people talked worry either dumb artificial intelligence super intelligent artificial intelligence destroying u people worry well nuclear weapon weapon war general
355,Lex Fridman," What do you think, if you had to... If you were a betting man, what would you bet on in terms of selfdestruction?",1900-01-01 01:28:42,think betting man would bet term selfdestruction
356,Lex Fridman, And there would be higher than 50? Would it be higher than 50 percent?,1900-01-01 01:28:48,would higher would higher percent
357,Joscha Bach, So it's very likely that nothing that be bet on matters after we win our bets. So I don't think that bets are literally the right thing... way to go about this.,1900-01-01 01:28:51,likely nothing bet matter win bet think bet literally right thing way go
358,Lex Fridman," I mean, once you're dead, it doesn't mean you won't be there to collect the ... winnings.",1900-01-01 01:29:00,mean dead mean collect winning
359,Joscha Bach, So it's also not clear if we as a species go extinct. But I think that our present civilization is not sustainable. So the thing that will change is: there will be probably fewer people on the planet than are today.,1900-01-01 01:29:04,also clear specie go extinct think present civilization sustainable thing change probably fewer people planet today
360,Joscha Bach," And even if not, then still, most of people that are alive today will not have offspring 100 years from now because of the geographic changes and so on and the changes in the food supply. It's quite likely that many areas of the planet will only be liveable with a closed cooling chain in 100 years from now. So many of the areas around the equator and in a subtropical climates that are now quite pleasant to live in, will stop to be inhabitable without air conditioning.",1900-01-01 01:29:16,even still people alive today offspring year geographic change change food supply quite likely many area planet liveable closed cooling chain year many area around equator subtropical climate quite pleasant live stop inhabitable without air conditioning
361,Lex Fridman," So you honest... wow cooling chain, close knit cooling chain communities. So you think... You have a strong worry about the the effects of global warming ...?",1900-01-01 01:29:44,honest wow cooling chain close knit cooling chain community think strong worry effect global warming
362,Joscha Bach," By itself, it's not a big issue. If you are living in Arizona right now, you have basically three months in the summer in which you cannot be outside.",1900-01-01 01:29:55,big issue living arizona right basically three month summer cannot outside
363,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:30:01,yes
364,Joscha Bach," And so you have a closed cooling chain. You have air conditioning in your car and in your home, and you're fine. And if the air conditioning would stop for a few days, then in many areas you would not be able to survive.",1900-01-01 01:30:02,closed cooling chain air conditioning car home fine air conditioning would stop day many area would able survive
365,Lex Fridman," Can we just pause for a second? Like you say, so many brilliant poetic things... Like what is it? Is that... Do people use that term: closed cooling chain?",1900-01-01 01:30:13,pause second like say many brilliant poetic thing like people use term closed cooling chain
366,Joscha Bach, I imagine that people use it when they describe how they get meat into a supermarket. Right. If you break the cooling chain and it starts to thaw you are in trouble and you have to throw it away.,1900-01-01 01:30:22,imagine people use describe get meat supermarket right break cooling chain start thaw trouble throw away
367,Joscha Bach," The thing is, there's such a beautiful way to put it. So calling a city a closed social chain or something like that, I mean. That's right. I mean, the locality of is really what",1900-01-01 01:30:33,thing beautiful way put calling city closed social chain something like mean right mean locality really
368,Joscha Bach," It basically means, you wake up in the climatized room, you go to work in a climatized car, you work in a climatized office...",1900-01-01 01:30:43,basically mean wake climatized room go work climatized car work climatized office
369,Joscha Bach, and are all interconnected...,1900-01-01 01:30:47,interconnected
370,Joscha Bach, you shop in a acclimatize supermarket.,1900-01-01 01:30:47,shop acclimatize supermarket
371,Joscha Bach," And in between you have very short distance, which you run from your car to the supermarket. But you have to make sure that your temperature does not approach the temperature of the environment. And the crucial thing is the wet-bulb temperature.",1900-01-01 01:30:50,short distance run car supermarket make sure temperature approach temperature environment crucial thing wet bulb temperature
372,Lex Fridman, The what?,1900-01-01 01:31:02,
373,Joscha Bach, The wet-bulb temperature. It's what you get when you take a wet cloth and you put it around your thermometer and then you move it very quickly through the air so you get the evaporation heat.,1900-01-01 01:31:03,wet bulb temperature get take wet cloth put around thermometer move quickly air get evaporation heat
374,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:31:14,yes
375,Joscha Bach," And as soon as you can no longer cool your body temperature via evaporation to a temperature below something like, I think 35 degrees, you die.",1900-01-01 01:31:15,soon longer cool body temperature via evaporation temperature something like think degree die
376,Lex Fridman, Right.,1900-01-01 01:31:25,right
377,Joscha Bach," And... Which means if the outside world is dry, you can still cool yourself down by sweating. But if it has a certain degree of humidity or if it goes over a certain temperature, then sweating will not save you. And this means even if you're a healthy, fit individual, within a few hours, even if you try to be in the shade and so on, you will die. Unless you have some climatizing equipment. And this itself, if you as long as you maintain civilization and you have energy supply and you have food trucks coming to your home that are acclimatized, everything is fine.",1900-01-01 01:31:26,mean outside world dry still cool sweating certain degree humidity go certain temperature sweating save mean even healthy fit individual within hour even try shade die unless climatizing equipment long maintain civilization energy supply food truck coming home acclimatized everything fine
378,Joscha Bach," But what if you lose large scale, open agriculture at the same time? So basically you run into food insecurity because climate becomes very irregular or weather becomes very irregular and you have a lot of extreme weather events.",1900-01-01 01:31:58,lose large scale open agriculture time basically run food insecurity climate becomes irregular weather becomes irregular lot extreme weather event
379,Joscha Bach," So you need to grow most of your food maybe indoor, or you need to import your food from certain regions .And maybe you're not able to maintain the civilization throughout the planet to get the infrastructure to get the food to your home.",1900-01-01 01:32:11,need grow food maybe indoor need import food certain region maybe able maintain civilization throughout planet get infrastructure get food home
380,Joscha Bach," All right. But there could be... So there could be significant impacts in the sense that people begin to suffer. There could be wars over resources and so on. But ultimately, do you do you not have a fai...not a faith? But, what do you make of the capacity of technol... technological innovation to help us prevent some of the worst damages that this condition can create? So..eh.. as an example, as an almost out there example, is the work of the SpaceX and Elon Musk is doing of trying to also consider our propagation throughout the universe in deep space to colonize other planets. That's one technological step.",1900-01-01 01:32:25,right could could significant impact sense people begin suffer could war resource ultimately fai faith make capacity technol technological innovation help u prevent worst damage condition create eh example almost example work spacex elon musk trying also consider propagation throughout universe deep space colonize planet one technological step
381,Joscha Bach," Yeah. But of course, what Elon Musk is trying on Mars is not to save us on global warming. Because Mars looks much worse than planet Earth will look like after the worst outcomes of global warming imaginable. Right? but Mars is essentially not habitable.",1900-01-01 01:33:09,yeah course elon musk trying mar save u global warming mar look much worse planet earth look like worst outcome global warming imaginable right mar essentially habitable
382,Lex Fridman," It's exceptionally harsh environment, yes. But what he is doing, what a lot of people throughout history, since the Industrial Revolution are doing are just doing a lot of different technological innovation with some kind of target. And what ends up happening is totally unexpected new things come up. So trying to trying to terraform or trying to colonize Mars, extremely harsh environment, might give us totally new ideas of how to expand or increase the power of this closed cooling circuit that that empowers the community.",1900-01-01 01:33:23,exceptionally harsh environment yes lot people throughout history since industrial revolution lot different technological innovation kind target end happening totally unexpected new thing come trying trying terraform trying colonize mar extremely harsh environment might give u totally new idea expand increase power closed cooling circuit empowers community
383,Lex Fridman," So, like, it seems like there's a little bit of a race between our open ended technological innovation of this, uh, communal operating system that we have and our general tendency to want to overuse resources and thereby destroy ourselves. You don't think technology can win that race?",1900-01-01 01:33:57,like seems like little bit race open ended technological innovation uh communal operating system general tendency want overuse resource thereby destroy think technology win race
384,Joscha Bach," I think the probability is relatively low, given that our technology is ... for instance ... In the US is stagnating since the 1970s roughly, in terms of technology. Most of the things that we do are the result of incremental processes.",1900-01-01 01:34:22,think probability relatively low given technology instance u stagnating since roughly term technology thing result incremental process
385,Lex Fridman, What about Intel? What about Moore's Law?,1900-01-01 01:34:36,intel moore law
386,Joscha Bach," It's basically- it's very incremental. The things that we are doing is... So after... The invention of the microprocessor was a major thing, right? The miniaturisation of transistors was really major. But the things that we did afterwards largely were not that innovative.",1900-01-01 01:34:38,basically incremental thing invention microprocessor major thing right miniaturisation transistor really major thing afterwards largely innovative
387,Lex Fridman, So hold on a second...,1900-01-01 01:34:57,hold second
388,Joscha Bach," Structural changes of scaling things into from GPUs into...from CPUs into GPUs and things like that. But I don't think that there are... Basically, there are not many things, if you take a person that died in the 70s and was at the top of their game, they would not need to read that many books to be current again.",1900-01-01 01:34:57,structural change scaling thing gpus cpu gpus thing like think basically many thing take person died top game would need read many book current

390,Joscha Bach, Papers...,1900-01-01 01:35:24,paper
391,Lex Fridman," no Papers. Forget papers. There might be things that are... So papers and books and knowledge thats a... Thats a concept of a time when you were sitting there by candlelight and individual consumers of knowledge. What about the impact that we're not in the middle of? We're not might not be understanding of Twitter, of YouTube. The reason you and I are sitting here today is because of Twitter and YouTube.",1900-01-01 01:35:24,paper forget paper might thing paper book knowledge thats thats concept time sitting candlelight individual consumer knowledge impact middle might understanding twitter youtube reason sitting today twitter youtube
392,Lex Fridman," So the the ripple effect and there's there's two minds, sort of two dumb apes are coming up with a new perhaps a new clean insights. And there's two hundred other apes we're seeing right now, 200000 other apes listening right now.",1900-01-01 01:35:47,ripple effect two mind sort two dumb ape coming new perhaps new clean insight two hundred ape seeing right ape listening right
393,Lex Fridman," And that effect, it's very difficult to understand what that effect will have. That might be bigger than any of the advancements of the microprocessor or the industrial revolution, the ability of spread knowledge. And that that that knowledge, the... like it allows good ideas to reach millions much faster. And the effect of that, that might be the new that might be the 21st century... Is the multiply the multiplying of ideas of good ideas. Because if you say one good thing today that will multiply across, you know, huge amounts of people and then they will say something and then they will have another podcast and they'll say something and then they'll write a paper that that could be a huge... You don't think that...",1900-01-01 01:36:01,effect difficult understand effect might bigger advancement microprocessor industrial revolution ability spread knowledge knowledge like allows good idea reach million much faster effect might new might century multiply multiplying idea good idea say one good thing today multiply across know huge amount people say something another podcast say something write paper could huge think
394,Joscha Bach," Yeah, we should have billions of von Neumanns right now, and Turings and we don't for some reason. I suspect the reason is that you destroy our attention span.",1900-01-01 01:36:48,yeah billion von neumann right turing reason suspect reason destroy attention span
395,Joscha Bach," Also the incentives, of course, are different.",1900-01-01 01:36:57,also incentive course different
396,Lex Fridman," Yeah well, Kim Kardashians, yeah.",1900-01-01 01:36:58,yeah well kim kardashians yeah
397,Joscha Bach," So the reason why we're sitting here and doing this as a YouTube video is because you and me don't have the attention span to write a book together right now and you guys probably don't have the attention span to read it. So let me tell you very short, intense",1900-01-01 01:37:01,reason sitting youtube video attention span write book together right guy probably attention span read let tell short intense

400,Lex Fridman," but we're... you know, we're an hour and 40 minutes in and I guarantee you that 80 percent of the people are still listening. So there is an attention span. It's just the form. You know, who said that the book is the optimal way to transfer information? That's still an open question.",1900-01-01 01:37:16,know hour minute guarantee percent people still listening attention span form know said book optimal way transfer information still open question
401,Lex Fridman, And that's what we're...,1900-01-01 01:37:31,
402,Joscha Bach," There's something that social media could be doing that other forms could not be doing. I think the end game of social media is a global brain. And Twitter is in some sense a global brain that is completely hooked on dopamine, doesn't have any kind of inhibition and as a result, it's caught in a permanent seizure.",1900-01-01 01:37:32,something social medium could form could think end game social medium global brain twitter sense global brain completely hooked dopamine kind inhibition result caught permanent seizure
403,Lex Fridman, Yes,1900-01-01 01:37:46,yes
404,Joscha Bach," it's also, in some sense, a multiplayer role playing game. And people use it to play an avatar that is not like them as they were in the sane world. And they look through the world through the lens of their phones and think it's the real world. But it's the Twitter world that is distorted by the popularity incentives of Twitter.",1900-01-01 01:37:47,also sense multiplayer role playing game people use play avatar like sane world look world lens phone think real world twitter world distorted popularity incentive twitter
405,Lex Fridman," Yeah, the incentives and just our natural biological... The dopamine rush of a like... No matter how... Like I consider... I try to be very kind of Zen like and minimalist and not be influenced by likes and so on. But it's probably very difficult to avoid that to some degree. Speaking at a small tangent of Twitter: what... How can be... How can Twitter be done better? I think it's an incredible mechanism that has a huge impact on society by doing exactly what you're doing... oh sorry, doing exactly what you described, which is having this... Well, like, is this some kind of game and we're kind of individuals RL agents in this game and it's uncontrollable because there's not really a centralized control. Neither Jack Dorsey nor the engineers at Twitter seem to be able to control this game. Or can they? That's sort of a question. Is there any advice you would give on how to control this game?",1900-01-01 01:38:03,yeah incentive natural biological dopamine rush like matter like consider try kind zen like minimalist influenced like probably difficult avoid degree speaking small tangent twitter twitter done better think incredible mechanism huge impact society exactly oh sorry exactly described well like kind game kind individual rl agent game uncontrollable really centralized control neither jack dorsey engineer twitter seem able control game sort question advice would give control game
406,Joscha Bach," So I wouldn't give advice, because I am certainly not an expert, but I can give my thoughts on this. And I ... Our brain is... has solved this problem to some degree, right? Our brain has lots of individual agents that manage to play together in a way. And you have also many context in which other organisms have found ways to solve the problems of cooperation that we don't solve on Twitter. And maybe the solution is to go for an evolutionary approach.",1900-01-01 01:39:06,give advice certainly expert give thought brain solved problem degree right brain lot individual agent manage play together way also many context organism found way solve problem cooperation solve twitter maybe solution go evolutionary approach
407,Joscha Bach," So imagine that you have something like Reddit or something like Facebook and something like Twitter, and you think about what they have in common. What they have in common: they're companies that in some sense own a protocol. And this protocol is imposed on a community. And the protocol has different components for monetization, for user management, for user display, for rating, for anonymity, for import of other content and so on.",1900-01-01 01:39:34,imagine something like reddit something like facebook something like twitter think common common company sense protocol protocol imposed community protocol different component monetization user management user display rating anonymity import content
408,Joscha Bach," And now imagine that you take these components of the protocol apart and you do it in some sense like communities within this social network. And these communities are allowed to mix and match their protocols and design new ones. So, for instance, the UI and the UX can be defined by the community. The rules for sharing content across communities can be defined. The monetization can be redefined. The way you reward individual users for what, can be redefined. The way users can represent themselves to each other can be redefined and...",1900-01-01 01:39:59,imagine take component protocol apart sense like community within social network community allowed mix match protocol design new one instance ui ux defined community rule sharing content across community defined monetization redefined way reward individual user redefined way user represent redefined
409,Lex Fridman, But who could be redefiner? So can individual human beings build enough intuition to redefine those things?,1900-01-01 01:40:31,could redefiner individual human being build enough intuition redefine thing
410,Joscha Bach," This itself can become part of the protocol. So, for instance, it could be in some communities it will be a single person that comes up with these things and other it's a group of friends. Some might implement a voting scheme that has some interesting weighted voting. Who knows? Who knows what will be the best self organizing principle for this?",1900-01-01 01:40:36,become part protocol instance could community single person come thing group friend might implement voting scheme interesting weighted voting know know best self organizing principle
411,Lex Fridman," But the process can't be automated. I mean, it seems like the brain...",1900-01-01 01:40:53,process automated mean seems like brain
412,Joscha Bach," It can be automated, so people can write software for this. And eventually the idea is: let's not make an assumption about this thing if you don't know what the right solution is. In those areas that you have no idea whether the right solution will be people designing this ad hoc, or machines doing this, whether you want to enforce compliance by social norms like Wikipedia, or with software solutions, or with A.I. that goes through the posts of people, or with a legal principle and so on - this is something maybe you need to find out.",1900-01-01 01:40:56,automated people write software eventually idea let make assumption thing know right solution area idea whether right solution people designing ad hoc machine whether want enforce compliance social norm like wikipedia software solution go post people legal principle something maybe need find
413,Joscha Bach," And so the idea would be, if you let the communities evolve.. And you just control it in such a way that you are incentivizing the more sentient communities, the ones that produce the most interesting behaviors and that allow you to interact in the most helpful ways to the individuals, right? So you have a network that gives you information that is relevant to you. It helps you to maintain relationships to others in healthy ways. It allows you to build teams.",1900-01-01 01:41:27,idea would let community evolve control way incentivizing sentient community one produce interesting behavior allow interact helpful way individual right network give information relevant help maintain relationship others healthy way allows build team
414,Joscha Bach," It allows you to basically to bring the best of you into this thing and goes into a coupling, into a relationship with others in which you produce things that you would be unable to produce alone.",1900-01-01 01:41:54,allows basically bring best thing go coupling relationship others produce thing would unable produce alone
415,Lex Fridman," Yes, beautifully put. So but the key process of that with incentives and evolution is things that don't adapt themselves to effectively get the incentives have to die. And the thing about social media is communities that are unhealthy or whatever you want to define as the incentives really don't like dying. One of the things that people really get aggressive... Protests aggressively is when they're censored, especially in America. I don't know... I don't know much about the rest of the world, but the idea of freedom of speech, the idea of censorship is really painful in America. And so. What yeah, what do you think about that, having grown up in East Germany? What... Do you think censorship is an important tool in our brain, in the intelligence and in the social networks? So basically, if you're not a good member of the entirety of the system, you should be blocked away, locked away, blocked?",1900-01-01 01:42:03,yes beautifully put key process incentive evolution thing adapt effectively get incentive die thing social medium community unhealthy whatever want define incentive really like dying one thing people really get aggressive protest aggressively censored especially america know know much rest world idea freedom speech idea censorship really painful america yeah think grown east germany think censorship important tool brain intelligence social network basically good member entirety system blocked away locked away blocked
416,Joscha Bach," An important thing is, who decides that you are a good member?",1900-01-01 01:43:12,important thing decides good member
417,Lex Fridman, who... Is it distributed or... ?,1900-01-01 01:43:15,distributed
418,Joscha Bach," And what is the outcome of the process that decides it? Both for the individual and for society at large. For instance, if you have a high trust society, you don't need a lot of surveillance. And the surveillance is even in some sense undermining trust.",1900-01-01 01:43:17,outcome process decides individual society large instance high trust society need lot surveillance surveillance even sense undermining trust
419,Lex Fridman, Yeah.,1900-01-01 01:43:32,yeah
420,Joscha Bach, Because it's basically punishing people that look suspicious when surveyed but do the right thing anyway. And the opposite: if you have a low trust society and then surveillance can be a better trade off.,1900-01-01 01:43:32,basically punishing people look suspicious surveyed right thing anyway opposite low trust society surveillance better trade
421,Joscha Bach," And the US is currently making the transition from a relatively high-trust or mixed-trust society to a low-trust society. So surveillance will increase. Another thing is that beliefs are not just inert representations. They are implementations that run code on your brain and change your reality and change the way you interact with each other, at some level. And some of the beliefs are just public opinions that we used to display our alignment. So, for instance, people might say all cultures have... are the same and equally good. But still, they prefer to live in some cultures over others, very, very strongly so. And it turns out that their cultures are defined by certain rules of interaction, and these rules of interaction lead to different results when you implement them, right? So if you adhere to certain rules, you get different outcomes in different societies. And this all leads to very tricky situations when people do not have a commitment to a shared purpose. And our societies probably need to rediscover what it means to have a shared purpose and how to make this compatible with a non-totalitarian view. So in some sense, the US is caught in a conundrum between totalitarianism and diversity and doesn't [know] to how to resolve this and the solutions that the U.S. has found so far are very crude because it's a very young society that is also under a lot of tension.",1900-01-01 01:43:45,u currently making transition relatively high trust mixed trust society low trust society surveillance increase another thing belief inert representation implementation run code brain change reality change way interact level belief public opinion used display alignment instance people might say culture equally good still prefer live culture others strongly turn culture defined certain rule interaction rule interaction lead different result implement right adhere certain rule get different outcome different society lead tricky situation people commitment shared purpose society probably need rediscover mean shared purpose make compatible non totalitarian view sense u caught conundrum totalitarianism diversity know resolve solution u found far crude young society also lot tension
422,Joscha Bach, So it seems to me that the US will have to reinvent itself.,1900-01-01 01:45:05,seems u reinvent
423,Lex Fridman," What do you think? Just the... Philosophising. What kind of mechanisms of government do you think we as a species should be evolving with, US or broadly, what do you think will work well? As a system. Of course, we don't know, it all seems to work pretty crappy, some things worse than others. Some people argue that communism is the best. Others say, yeah, look at the Soviet Union. Some people argue that anarchy is the best and then completely discarding the positive effects of government. You know, there's a lot of arguments. US seems to be doing pretty damn well in the span of history. There's respect for human rights, which seems to be a nice feature, not a bug. And economically, a lot of growth, a lot of technological development. People seem to be relatively kind on the grand scheme of things. Well, what lessons do you draw from that? What kind of government system do you think is good?",1900-01-01 01:45:08,think philosophising kind mechanism government think specie evolving u broadly think work well system course know seems work pretty crappy thing worse others people argue communism best others say yeah look soviet union people argue anarchy best completely discarding positive effect government know lot argument u seems pretty damn well span history respect human right seems nice feature bug economically lot growth lot technological development people seem relatively kind grand scheme thing well lesson draw kind government system think good
424,Joscha Bach," Ideally, governments should not be perceivable, right? It should be frictionless. The more you notice the influence of the government, the more friction you experience, the less effective and efficient the government probably is. Right? So a government, game theoretically, is an agent that imposes an offset on your payout metrics to make your Nash equilibrium compatible with the common good. Right? So you have these situations where people act on the local incentives and these local incentives, everybody does the thing that's locally the best for them. But the global outcome is not good. And this is even the case when people care about the global outcome because a regulation mechanism exists that creates a causal relationship between what I want to have for the global good and what I do. So, for instance, if I think that we should fly less and I stay at home, there's not a single plane that is going to not start because of me. Right? It's not going to have an influence, but I don't get from A to B. So the way to implement this would be to have a government that is sharing this idea that we should fly less and is then imposing a regulation that, for instance, makes flying more expensive and gives incentives for inventing other forms of transportation that are less... putting less strain on the environment, for instance.",1900-01-01 01:46:10,ideally government perceivable right frictionless notice influence government friction experience le effective efficient government probably right government game theoretically agent imposes offset payout metric make nash equilibrium compatible common good right situation people act local incentive local incentive everybody thing locally best global outcome good even case people care global outcome regulation mechanism exists creates causal relationship want global good instance think fly le stay home single plane going start right going influence get b way implement would government sharing idea fly le imposing regulation instance make flying expensive give incentive inventing form transportation le putting le strain environment instance
425,Lex Fridman," So there's so much optimism in so many things you describe. And yet there's the pessimism of you think our civilization is going to come to an end. So that's not a 100 percent probability. Nothing in this world is. So what's the trajectory out of self-destruction, do you think?",1900-01-01 01:47:29,much optimism many thing describe yet pessimism think civilization going come end percent probability nothing world trajectory self destruction think
426,Joscha Bach," I suspect that in some sense we are both too smart and not smart enough. Which means we are very good at solving near-term problems. And at the same time, we are unwilling to submit to the imperatives of... that we would have to follow in if you want to stick around.",1900-01-01 01:47:46,suspect sense smart smart enough mean good solving near term problem time unwilling submit imperative would follow want stick around
427,Lex Fridman, Right.,1900-01-01 01:48:02,right
428,Joscha Bach," So that makes it difficult. If you were unable to solve everything technologically, you can probably understand how high the child mortality needs to be to absorb the mutation rate and how high the mutation mutation rate needs to be to adapt to a slowly changing ecosystemic environment. Right? So you could in principle compute all these things game theoretically and adapt to it. But if you cannot do this because you are like me and you have children, you don't want them to die, you will use any kind of medical information to keep child mortality low, even if it means that our... within a few generations we have enormous genetic drift and most of us have allergies as a result of not being adapted because of the changes that we made to our food supply.",1900-01-01 01:48:02,make difficult unable solve everything technologically probably understand high child mortality need absorb mutation rate high mutation mutation rate need adapt slowly changing ecosystemic environment right could principle compute thing game theoretically adapt cannot like child want die use kind medical information keep child mortality low even mean within generation enormous genetic drift u allergy result adapted change made food supply
429,Lex Fridman," That's for now. I say technologically speaking, which is a very, very, very young, you know, 300 years industrial revolution, we are very new to this idea. So you're attached to your kids being alive and not being murdered for the greater good of society. But that might be a very temporary moment of time.",1900-01-01 01:48:44,say technologically speaking young know year industrial revolution new idea attached kid alive murdered greater good society might temporary moment time
430,Joscha Bach, Yes.,1900-01-01 01:48:59,yes
431,Lex Fridman," That we might we might evolve. And I think it's ...So like you said, we're... We're both smart and not smart enough,",1900-01-01 01:49:00,might might evolve think like said smart smart enough
432,Joscha Bach," We are probably not the first human civilization that has discovered technology that allows to efficiently overgraze our resources. And this overgrazing is, I think, at some point, we think we can compensate this, because if we have eaten all the rice, we will find a way to grow mushrooms. Right. But it could also be that the ecosystems tip. And so what really concerns me is not so much the end of the civilization because we will invent a new one.",1900-01-01 01:49:07,probably first human civilization discovered technology allows efficiently overgraze resource overgrazing think point think compensate eaten rice find way grow mushroom right could also ecosystem tip really concern much end civilization invent new one
433,Joscha Bach," But what concerns me is the fact that, for instance, the oceans might tip. So, for instance, maybe the plankton dies because of ocean acidification and cyanobacteria take over and as a result, we can no longer breathe the atmosphere. This would be really concerning. So basically major reboot of most complex organisms on Earth. And I think this is a possibility. I don't know if what the percentage for this possibility is, but it doesn't seem to be outlandish to me. If you look at the scale of the changes that we've already triggered on this planet and so Danny Hillis suggests that, for instance, we maybe able to put chalk into the stratosphere to limit solar radiation. Maybe it works, maybe this is sufficient to counter the effects of what we've done.",1900-01-01 01:49:32,concern fact instance ocean might tip instance maybe plankton dy ocean acidification cyanobacteria take result longer breathe atmosphere would really concerning basically major reboot complex organism earth think possibility know percentage possibility seem outlandish look scale change already triggered planet danny hillis suggests instance maybe able put chalk stratosphere limit solar radiation maybe work maybe sufficient counter effect done
434,Joscha Bach," Maybe it won't be maybe we won't be able to implement it by the time it's prevalent. I have no idea how the future is going to play out in this regard. It's just, uh, I think it's quite likely that we cannot continue like this. All our cousins species, the other hominids are gone.",1900-01-01 01:50:15,maybe maybe able implement time prevalent idea future going play regard uh think quite likely cannot continue like cousin specie hominid gone
435,Lex Fridman, So so the right step would be to what? To rewind... To rewind towards the industrial revolution and slow the.. so try to contain the technological process that leads to overconsumption of resources?,1900-01-01 01:50:31,right step would rewind rewind towards industrial revolution slow try contain technological process lead overconsumption resource
436,Joscha Bach," Um, imagine you get to choose. You have one lifetime.",1900-01-01 01:50:48,um imagine get choose one lifetime

438,Joscha Bach," You get born into a sustainable agricultural civilization, 300, maybe 400 million people on the planet, tops. Or before this, some kind of nomadic species like a million or two million. And so you don't meet new people unless you give birth to them. You cannot travel to other places in the world, there is no Internet, there is no interesting intellectual tradition that reaches considerably deep, so you would not discover Turing completeness probably, and so on. We wouldn't exist. And the alternative is you get born into an insane world. One that is doomed to die because it has just burned 100 million years worth of trees in a single century...",1900-01-01 01:50:51,get born sustainable agricultural civilization maybe million people planet top kind nomadic specie like million two million meet new people unless give birth cannot travel place world internet interesting intellectual tradition reach considerably deep would discover turing completeness probably exist alternative get born insane world one doomed die burned million year worth tree single century

440,Joscha Bach," I think I like this one. It's a very weird thing that when you find yourself on a Titanic and you see this iceberg and it looks like we are not going to miss it and a lot of people are in denial. And most of the counterarguments sound like denial to me. They don't seem to be rational arguments. And the other thing is we are born on this Titanic. Without this Titanic, we wouldn't have been born. We wouldn't be here. We wouldn't be talking. We wouldn't be on the Internet. We wouldn't do all the things that we enjoy. And we are not responsible for this happening. It's basically, if we had the choice, we would probably try to prevent it. But when we were born, we were never asked when we want to be born, in which society we want to be born, what incentive structures we want to be exposed to. We have relatively little agency in the entire thing. Humanity has relatively little agency in the whole thing. It's basically a giant machine, it's tumbling down a hill and everybody is frantically trying to push some buttons, nobody knows what these buttons are meaning, what they connect to. And most of them are not stopping this tumbling down the hill.",1900-01-01 01:51:31,think like one weird thing find titanic see iceberg look like going miss lot people denial counterargument sound like denial seem rational argument thing born titanic without titanic born talking internet thing enjoy responsible happening basically choice would probably try prevent born never asked want born society want born incentive structure want exposed relatively little agency entire thing humanity relatively little agency whole thing basically giant machine tumbling hill everybody frantically trying push button nobody know button meaning connect stopping tumbling hill
441,Lex Fridman," Is it possible that artificial intelligence will give us an escape latch somehow, so the... You know, there's a lot of worry about existential threats of of artificial intelligence, but what AI also allows and general forms of automation, allows the potential of extreme productivity growth that will also perhaps in a positive way, transform society that may allow us to inadvertently to return to the more to the same kind of ideals of closer to nature that's represented in Hunter-Gatherer societies. You know, that's not destroying the planet, that's not doing overconsumption and so on. I mean, generally speaking, do you have hope that I can help some?",1900-01-01 01:52:29,possible artificial intelligence give u escape latch somehow know lot worry existential threat artificial intelligence ai also allows general form automation allows potential extreme productivity growth also perhaps positive way transform society may allow u inadvertently return kind ideal closer nature represented hunter gatherer society know destroying planet overconsumption mean generally speaking hope help

448,Joscha Bach," Yes, if you are adapted to it. Basically, if your brain is wired up in such a way that you get rewards optimally in such an environment and there is some evidence for this that for a certain degree of complexity, basically people are more happy in such an environment because it's what you largely have evolved for. In between we had a few thousand years in which, I think, we have evolved for a slightly more comfortable environment. So there is probably something like an intermediate stage in which people would be more happy than they would be if they would have to fend for themselves in small groups in the forest and often die, versus something like this, where we now have basically a big machine, a big Mordor in which we run through concrete boxes and press buttons and machines and largely don't feel well cared for as the monkeys that we are.",1900-01-01 01:54:36,yes adapted basically brain wired way get reward optimally environment evidence certain degree complexity basically people happy environment largely evolved thousand year think evolved slightly comfortable environment probably something like intermediate stage people would happy would would fend small group forest often die versus something like basically big machine big mordor run concrete box press button machine largely feel well cared monkey
449,Joscha Bach," So returning briefly to... Not briefly, but returning to AI what... Let me ask a romanticised question: What is the most beautiful to you, silly ape, the most beautiful or surprising idea in the development of artificial intelligence, whether in your own life or in the history of artificial intelligence that you've come across.",1900-01-01 01:55:29,returning briefly briefly returning ai let ask romanticised question beautiful silly ape beautiful surprising idea development artificial intelligence whether life history artificial intelligence come across
450,Joscha Bach," If you built an A.I., it probably can make models at an arbitrary degree of detail, right, of the world. And then it would try to understand its own nature. It's tempting to think that at some point when we have general intelligence, we have competitions where we will let the AIs wake up in different kinds of physical universes and we measure how many movements of the Rubik's Cube it takes until it's figured out what's going on in its universe. And what it is in its own nature and its own physics and so on. Right? So what if we exist in the memory of an AI that is trying to understand its own nature and remembers its own genesis and remembers Lex and Joshua sitting in the hotel room, sparking some of the ideas off that led to the development of general intelligence.",1900-01-01 01:55:50,built probably make model arbitrary degree detail right world would try understand nature tempting think point general intelligence competition let ai wake different kind physical universe measure many movement rubik cube take figured going universe nature physic right exist memory ai trying understand nature remembers genesis remembers lex joshua sitting hotel room sparking idea led development general intelligence

453,Lex Fridman," I mean, um. Yeah, you kind of return to this idea with the Turing test of intelligence being... of intelligence being the process of asking and answering what is intelligence? I mean, what? Why... Do you think there's there is an answer? Why is there such a search for an answer? So does there have to be like an answer, you just said an AI system that's trying to understand the why of what... You know, understand itself. Is that a fundamental process of greater and greater complexity, greater greater intelligence, is the continuous trying of understanding itself?",1900-01-01 01:56:45,mean um yeah kind return idea turing test intelligence intelligence process asking answering intelligence mean think answer search answer like answer said ai system trying understand know understand fundamental process greater greater complexity greater greater intelligence continuous trying understanding
454,Joscha Bach," No, I think you will find that most people don't care about that. Because they're well adjusted enough to not care. And the reason why people like you and me who care about it probably has to do with the need to understand ourselves. It's because we are in fundamental disagreement with the universe, that we wake up in. I look down on me and I see, oh, my God, I'm caught in a monkey. What's that?",1900-01-01 01:57:31,think find people care well adjusted enough care reason people like care probably need understand fundamental disagreement universe wake look see oh god caught monkey
455,Lex Fridman," Right. Thats the feeling, right?",1900-01-01 01:57:53,right thats feeling right

459,Lex Fridman," Well, no, that's not what I asked. So so you have to clear adaptive value then there's clear adaptive value to, while fundamental, your brain is confused by that by creating an illusion, another layer of the narrative that says, you know, that tries to suppress that and instead say that, you know, what's going on with the government right now is the most important thing.

460,Lex Fridman," But it seems to me.... the... Like for me was a really interesting moment reading Ernest Becker's Denial of Death that, you know, this kind of idea that we're all, you know, the fundamental thing from which most of our human mind springs is this fear of immortality, of being cognizant of your mortality and the fear of that mortality. And then you construct illusions on top of that. I guess I'm... You being ...Just to push on it, you really don't think it's possible that this worry of the big existential questions is actually fundamental as far as the existentialist thought to our existence?",1900-01-01 01:58:41,seems like really interesting moment reading ernest becker denial death know kind idea know fundamental thing human mind spring fear immortality cognizant mortality fear mortality construct illusion top guess push really think possible worry big existential question actually fundamental far existentialist thought existence
461,Joscha Bach," No, I think that the fear of death only plays a role as long as you don't see the big picture. The thing is that minds are software states, right? Software doesn't have identity.

Assigning it ...,1900-01-01 01:59:45,feel like identity thought particular piece software narrative tell fundamental property assigning
465,Joscha Bach," The maintenance of the identity is not terminal, it's instrumental to something else. You maintain your identity so you can serve your meaning. So you can do the things that you're supposed to do before you die. And I suspect that for most people, the fear of death is the fear of dying before they are done with the things that they feel they have to do, even though they cannot quite put their finger on it what it is, what that is.",1900-01-01 01:59:54,maintenance identity terminal instrumental something else maintain identity serve meaning thing supposed die suspect people fear death fear dying done thing feel even though cannot quite put finger

468,Lex Fridman," Well, maybe I'm not. This is what, you know... It seems like there's so much... In the idea that this is just... The mind is just a simulation that's constructing a narrative around some particular aspects of the quantum mechanical wavefunction world that we can't quite get direct access to... Then, like the idea of mortality seems to be a little fuzzy as well. It doesn't...

483,Joscha Bach," Yes, and you can basically meditate yourself in a state where you are still conscious. There's still things are happening.

486,Joscha Bach," Yea, so I'm attached...I mean, yeah, there is a very popular... It's somehow a compelling notion that being being attached, like there's no need to be attached to this idea of an identity. But that in itself could be a, an illusion that you can structure the process of meditation, while popular, is thought of as getting under the concept of identity. It could be just putting a cloak over it, just telling it to be quiet for the moment, you know?",1900-01-01 02:03:04,yea attached mean yeah popular somehow compelling notion attached like need attached idea identity could illusion structure process meditation popular thought getting concept identity could putting cloak telling quiet moment know
487,Joscha Bach," I think that meditation is eventually just a bunch of techniques that let you control attention. And when you can control the attention, you can get access to your own source code.

491,Joscha Bach," Normally we only get attention in the parts of our mind that create heat, where you have a mismatch between model and the results that are happening. And so most people are not self-aware because their control is too good. If everything works out roughly the way you want and the only things that don't work out is whether your football team wins, then you will mostly have models about these domains. And it's only when, for instance, your fundamental relationships to the world around you don't work because the ideology of your country is insane and the other kids are not nerds and don't understand why you understand physics and you don't know why you want to understand physics and you don't understand why somebody would not want to understand physics.",1900-01-01 02:04:08,normally get attention part mind create heat mismatch model result happening people self aware control good everything work roughly way want thing work whether football team win mostly model domain instance fundamental relationship world around work ideology country insane kid nerd understand understand physic know want understand physic understand somebody would want understand physic
492,Lex Fridman," So we've kind of brought up neurons in the brain as Reinforcement Learning agents. And there's been some successes, as you brought up with Go with Alpha Go, Alpha Zero, with ideas of self play, which I think are incredibly interesting ideas of systems playing each other and in an automated way, to improve by playing other systems of in a particular construct of a game that are a little bit better than itself and thereby improving continuously. All the competitors in the game are improving gradually. So being just challenging enough and learning from the process of the competition. Do you have hope for that reinforcement learning process to achieve greater and greater level of intelligence? So we talked about different ideas in AI that we need to be solved. Is RL a part of that process of trying to create an AGI system? So what do you think?",1900-01-01 02:04:48,kind brought neuron brain reinforcement learning agent success brought go alpha go alpha zero idea self play think incredibly interesting idea system playing automated way improve playing system particular construct game little bit better thereby improving continuously competitor game improving gradually challenging enough learning process competition hope reinforcement learning process achieve greater greater level intelligence talked different idea ai need solved rl part process trying create agi system think
493,Joscha Bach," Basically forms of unsupervised learning, but there are many algorithms that can achieve that. And I suspect that, ultimately, the algorithms that work, there will be a class of them or many of them, and they might have small differences of like magnitude and efficiency. But eventually what matters is the type of model that you form. And the types of models that we form right now are not sparse enough.",1900-01-01 02:05:45,basically form unsupervised learning many algorithm achieve suspect ultimately algorithm work class many might small difference like magnitude efficiency eventually matter type model form type model form right sparse enough

495,Joscha Bach," It means that ideally every potential model-state should correspond to a potential world state. So basically, if you vary states and your model, you always end up with valid world states and our mind is not quite there. So an indication is basically what we see in dreams. The older we get, the more boring our dreams become because we incorporate more and more constraints that we learned about how the world works. So many of the things that we imagine to be possible as children turn out to be constrained by physical and social dynamics.",1900-01-01 02:06:12,mean ideally every potential model state correspond potential world state basically vary state model always end valid world state mind quite indication basically see dream older get boring dream become incorporate constraint learned world work many thing imagine possible child turn constrained physical social dynamic
496,Joscha Bach," And as a result, fewer and fewer things remain possible. Its not because our imagination scales back, but the constraints under which it operates become tighter and tighter. And so the constraints under which our neural networks operate are almost limitless, which means it's very difficult to get a neural network to imagine things that look real.",1900-01-01 02:06:45,result fewer fewer thing remain possible imagination scale back constraint operates become tighter tighter constraint neural network operate almost limitless mean difficult get neural network imagine thing look real
497,Lex Fridman, Right.,1900-01-01 02:07:05,right
498,Joscha Bach," So I suspect part of what we need to do is, we probably need to build dreaming systems. I suspect that part of the purpose of dreams is to -similar to a Generative Adversarial Network- learn certain constraints, and then it produces alternative perspectives on the same set of constraints so you can recognize it under different circumstances. Maybe we have flying dreams as children because we recreate the objects that we know on the maps that we know from different perspectives, which also means from the bird's eye perspective.",1900-01-01 02:07:07,suspect part need probably need build dreaming system suspect part purpose dream similar generative adversarial network learn certain constraint produce alternative perspective set constraint recognize different circumstance maybe flying dream child recreate object know map know different perspective also mean bird eye perspective
499,Lex Fridman," So I mean, aren't we doing that anyway? I mean, not without with our eyes... And with our eyes closed and when we're sleeping... Aren't we just constantly running dreams and simulations in our mind as we try to interpret the environment? I mean, it's sort of considering all the different possibilities for the way we interact with the environment, seems like... essentially, like you said, sort of creating a bunch of simulations that are consistent with our expectations, with previous experiences, with the things we just saw recently and through that hallucination process, we are able to then somehow stitch together what actually we see in the world with the simulations that match it well and thereby interpret it.",1900-01-01 02:07:36,mean anyway mean without eye eye closed sleeping constantly running dream simulation mind try interpret environment mean sort considering different possibility way interact environment seems like essentially like said sort creating bunch simulation consistent expectation previous experience thing saw recently hallucination process able somehow stitch together actually see world simulation match well thereby interpret

504,Joscha Bach," It's not complicated. It's relatively easy to build a neural network that in some sense learns the dynamics. The fact that we haven't done it right so far, it doesn't mean it's hard, because you can see that a biological organism does it with relatively few neurons. So basically you build a bunch of neural oscillators that entrain themselves with the dynamics of your body in such a way that the regulator becomes isomorphic in its model to the dynamics that it regulates and then it's automatic. And it's only interesting in the sense that it captures attention when the system is off.",1900-01-01 02:08:58,complicated relatively easy build neural network sense learns dynamic fact done right far mean hard see biological organism relatively neuron basically build bunch neural oscillator entrain dynamic body way regulator becomes isomorphic model dynamic regulates automatic interesting sense capture attention system
505,Lex Fridman," But thinking of the kind of mechanism that's required to do walking as a controller is like a... as a... as a neural network. I think, I think it's a compelling notion, but it discards quietly or at least makes implicit the fact that you need to have something like common sense reasoning to walk. That's not is an open question whether you do or not. But my intuition is to be, to act in this world, there's a huge knowledge base that's underlying it, somehow. There's so much information of the kind we have never been able to construct in our... in neural networks and artificial intelligence systems, period. Which is like it's humbling, at least in my imagination. The amount of information required to act in this world humbles me. And I think saying that, Neural Networks can accomplish it, is missing... is missing the fact that we don't, yeah, we don't have yet a mechanism for constructing something like common sense reasoning. I mean, what's your sense? About, ehm, to linger on how much, you know, to linger on the idea of what kind of mechanism would be effective at walking, you said just a neural network, not maybe the kind we have, but something a little bit better would be able to walk easily, don't you think it also needs to know, like, huge amount of knowledge that's represented under the flag of common sense reasoning?",1900-01-01 02:09:29,thinking kind mechanism required walking controller like neural network think think compelling notion discard quietly least make implicit fact need something like common sense reasoning walk open question whether intuition act world huge knowledge base underlying somehow much information kind never able construct neural network artificial intelligence system period like humbling least imagination amount information required act world humbles think saying neural network accomplish missing missing fact yeah yet mechanism constructing something like common sense reasoning mean sense ehm linger much know linger idea kind mechanism would effective walking said neural network maybe kind something little bit better would able walk easily think also need know like huge amount knowledge represented flag common sense reasoning
506,Joscha Bach," How much common sense knowledge do we actually have? Imagine that you are really hard working through all your life and you form two new concepts every half hour or so.

509,Lex Fridman," Yea but the powerful thing is, the number of concepts in there, probably deeply hierarchical in nature. The relations, as you described between them, is the key thing. So it's like even if it's a million concepts, the graph of relations that's formed and some kind of perhaps some kind of probabilistic relationships, that's the that's what's common sense reasoning is the relationship between things that...",1900-01-01 02:11:37,yea powerful thing number concept probably deeply hierarchical nature relation described key thing like even million concept graph relation formed kind perhaps kind probabilistic relationship common sense reasoning relationship thing
510,Joscha Bach," Yes, so in some sense I think of the concepts as the addres- space for our behavior programs. And the behavior programs allow us to recognize objects and interact with them. Also mental objects. And large part of that is the physical world that we interact with, which is this Res Extenda thing, which is basically navigation of information and space. And basically it's similar to a game engine. It's a physics engine that you can use to describe and predict how things that look in a particular way, that feel when you touch them in a particular way, that of proprioception, that of auditory perception and so on, how they work out. So basically the geometry of all these things. And this is... Probably 80 percent of what our brain is doing is dealing with that, with this real time simulation. And by itself, a game engine is fascinating, but it's not that hard to understand what it's doing. Right? And our game engines are already, in some sense, approximating the fidelity of what we can perceive. So if we put on an Oculus Quest, we get something that is still relatively crude with respect to what we can perceive, but it's also in the same ballpark already, right? It's just a couple order of magnitude away from saturating our perception in terms of the complexity that it can produce. So in some sense, it's reasonable to say that our... the computer that you can buy and put into your home is able to give a perceptual reality that has the detail that is already in the same ballpark as what your brain can process. And everything else are ideas about the world. And I suspect that they are relatively sparse and also the intuitive models that we form about social interaction. Social interaction is is not so hard. It's just hard for us nerds because we all have our wires crossed so we need to deduce them. But the priors are present in most social animals. So it's interesting thing to note is that many domestic social animals, like cats and dogs, have better social recognition than children.",1900-01-01 02:12:06,yes sense think concept addres space behavior program behavior program allow u recognize object interact also mental object large part physical world interact re extenda thing basically navigation information space basically similar game engine physic engine use describe predict thing look particular way feel touch particular way proprioception auditory perception work basically geometry thing probably percent brain dealing real time simulation game engine fascinating hard understand right game engine already sense approximating fidelity perceive put oculus quest get something still relatively crude respect perceive also ballpark already right couple order magnitude away saturating perception term complexity produce sense reasonable say computer buy put home able give perceptual reality detail already ballpark brain process everything else idea world suspect relatively sparse also intuitive model form social interaction social interaction hard hard u nerd wire crossed need deduce prior present social animal interesting thing note many domestic social animal like cat dog better social recognition child

514,Joscha Bach," The thing is, our brains don't scale and the information processing that we built tend to scale very well.",1900-01-01 02:14:27,thing brain scale information processing built tend scale well
515,Joscha Bach," Yeah, but I mean, one of the things that worries me is that, you know, the fact that the brain doesn't scale means that that's actually a fundamental feature of the brain.",1900-01-01 02:14:33,yeah mean one thing worry know fact brain scale mean actually fundamental feature brain
516,Lex Fridman," You know, the all the flaws of the brain, everything we see that we see as limitations, perhaps as a fundamental, the constraints on the system could be the a requirement of its power, which is like different than our current understanding of intelligent systems where scale, especially with deep learning, especially with reinforcement learning the...the hope behind Open AI, Deep Mind, all the major results really have to do with huge compute. And yeah.",1900-01-01 02:14:43,know flaw brain everything see see limitation perhaps fundamental constraint system could requirement power like different current understanding intelligent system scale especially deep learning especially reinforcement learning hope behind open ai deep mind major result really huge compute yeah
517,Joscha Bach," Could also be that our brains are so small, not just because they take up so much glucose in our body, like 20 percent of the glucose, so they don't arbitrarily scale. There are some animals like elephants, which have larger brains than us, and it don't seem to be smarter, right.?",1900-01-01 02:15:16,could also brain small take much glucose body like percent glucose arbitrarily scale animal like elephant larger brain u seem smarter right
518,Joscha Bach," Elephants seem to be autistic. They have very, very good motor control and they're very good with details. But they really struggle to see the big picture. So you can make them recreate drawings, stroke by stroke, they can do that. But they cannot reproduce a still life. So they cannot make a drawing of a scene that they see. There will always be only able to reproduce the line drawing, at least as far from what I could see in the experiments.",1900-01-01 02:15:29,elephant seem autistic good motor control good detail really struggle see big picture make recreate drawing stroke stroke cannot reproduce still life cannot make drawing scene see always able reproduce line drawing least far could see experiment
519,Joscha Bach," So why is that? Maybe smarter elephants would meditate themselves out of existence because their brains are too large. So basically the elephants that were not autistic, they didn't reproduce.",1900-01-01 02:15:52,maybe smarter elephant would meditate existence brain large basically elephant autistic reproduce
520,Lex Fridman, Yeah. So we have to remember that the brain is fundamentally interlinked with the body and our human and the biological system. Do you think that AGI systems that we try to create or greater intelligence systems would need to have a body? So...,1900-01-01 02:16:03,yeah remember brain fundamentally interlinked body human biological system think agi system try create greater intelligence system would need body
521,Joscha Bach," I think they should be able to make use of a body if you give it to them. But I don't think they fundamental need a body. So I suspect if you can interact with the world by moving your eyes and your head you can make controlled experiments. And this allows you to have many magnitudes fewer observations in order to reduce the uncertainty in your models, right? So you can pinpoint the errors in your models, but you're not quite sure and you just move your head and see what's what's going on over there and you get additional information. If you just have to use YouTube, as an input and you cannot do anything beyond this, you probably need just much more data. But if we have much more data. So if you can build a system that has enough time and attention to browse all of YouTube and extract all the information that there is to be found, I don't think there's an obvious limit to what it can do.",1900-01-01 02:16:15,think able make use body give think fundamental need body suspect interact world moving eye head make controlled experiment allows many magnitude fewer observation order reduce uncertainty model right pinpoint error model quite sure move head see going get additional information use youtube input cannot anything beyond probably need much data much data build system enough time attention browse youtube extract information found think obvious limit
522,Joscha Bach," But it seems that the interactivity is a fundamental thing that the physical body allows you to do. But let me ask on that topic sort of that that sort of body is... is allowing the brain to, like, touch things and move things and interact with the way ... Whether the physical world exists or not, whatever, but interact with some interface to the physical world. What about a virtual world? Do you think... Do you think we can do the same kind of reasoning, consciousness, intelligence, if we put on a VR headset and move over to that world?",1900-01-01 02:17:05,seems interactivity fundamental thing physical body allows let ask topic sort sort body allowing brain like touch thing move thing interact way whether physical world exists whatever interact interface physical world virtual world think think kind reasoning consciousness intelligence put vr headset move world
523,Joscha Bach," Do you think there's a fundamental difference between the interface, the physical world, that it's here in this hotel and if we were sitting in the same hotel in a virtual world?",1900-01-01 02:17:40,think fundamental difference interface physical world hotel sitting hotel virtual world
524,Joscha Bach," The question is, does this physical... this non-physical world or this other environment, entice you to solve problems that require general intelligence? If it doesn't, then you probably will not develop general intelligence. And arguably, most people are not generally intelligent because they don't have to solve problems that make them generally intelligent. And even for us, it's not yet clear if we are smart enough build A.I. And understand our own nature to this degree, right? So it could be a matter of capacity. And for most people, it's in the first place, a matter of interest, they don't see the point. Because the benefit of attempting this project are marginal because you're probably not going to succeed in it. And the cost of trying to do it requires complete dedication of your entire life. Right?",1900-01-01 02:17:49,question physical non physical world environment entice solve problem require general intelligence probably develop general intelligence arguably people generally intelligent solve problem make generally intelligent even u yet clear smart enough build understand nature degree right could matter capacity people first place matter interest see point benefit attempting project marginal probably going succeed cost trying requires complete dedication entire life right
525,Lex Fridman," But it seems like the possibilities of what you can do in the virtual world ... so imagine that... is much greater than you can in the real world. So imagine a situation may be interesting option for me... If somebody came to me and offered, what I'll do...is...so from now on, you can only exist in the virtual world. And so you put on a headset and when you eat we'll make sure to connect your body up in a way that when you eat in the virtual world, your body will be nourished in the same way in the virtual world. So the aligning incentives between our common sort of real world and the virtual world, but then the possibilities become much bigger, like I could be other kinds of creatures, I could do... I can break the laws of physics as we know them. I could do a lot.. I mean, the possibilities are endless, right? That's as far as we think. It's an interesting thought whether, like what existence would be like, what kind of intelligence would emerge there, what kind of consciousness, what kind of maybe greater intelligence even mean me, Lex, even at this stage in my life, if I spend the next 20 years in the world to see how that intelligence emerges. And if I was... If that happened at the very beginning before I was even cognizant of my existence in this physical world, it's interesting to think how that child would develop and the way virtual reality and digitization of everything is moving. It's not completely out of the realm of possibility that we're all that some part of our lives will be, if not entirety of it, will live in a virtual world to a greater degree than we currently have living on Twitter and social media and so on. Do you have, I mean, does something draw you intellectually or naturally in terms of thinking about AI to this virtual world where more possibilities?",1900-01-01 02:18:29,seems like possibility virtual world imagine much greater real world imagine situation may interesting option somebody came offered exist virtual world put headset eat make sure connect body way eat virtual world body nourished way virtual world aligning incentive common sort real world virtual world possibility become much bigger like could kind creature could break law physic know could lot mean possibility endless right far think interesting thought whether like existence would like kind intelligence would emerge kind consciousness kind maybe greater intelligence even mean lex even stage life spend next year world see intelligence emerges happened beginning even cognizant existence physical world interesting think child would develop way virtual reality digitization everything moving completely realm possibility part life entirety live virtual world greater degree currently living twitter social medium mean something draw intellectually naturally term thinking ai virtual world possibility
526,Joscha Bach, I think that currently it's a waste of time to deal with the physical world before we have mechanisms that can automatically learn how to deal with it. The body gives you a second order agency. What constitutes the body is the things that you can indirectly control. Third order are tools.,1900-01-01 02:20:22,think currently waste time deal physical world mechanism automatically learn deal body give second order agency constitutes body thing indirectly control third order tool
527,Joscha Bach, Right,1900-01-01 02:20:38,right
528,Joscha Bach, And the second order is the things that are basically always present. But you operate on them first order things which are mental operators.,1900-01-01 02:20:39,second order thing basically always present operate first order thing mental operator
529,Joscha Bach, Yes.,1900-01-01 02:20:47,yes
530,Joscha Bach," And the zero order is, in some sense, the direct sense of what you're deciding.",1900-01-01 02:20:47,zero order sense direct sense deciding
531,Joscha Bach, Right.,1900-01-01 02:20:53,right
532,Joscha Bach," So you observe yourself initiating an action. There are features that you interpret as the initiation of an action. Then you perform the operations that you perform to make that happen. And then you see the movement of your limbs and you learn to associate those and thereby model your own agency over this feedback. Right? But the first feedback that you get is from this first order thing already. Basically, you decide to think a thought and the thought is being thought. You decide to change the thought and you observe how the thought is being changed. And in some sense this is, you could say, an embodiment already, right? And I suspect it's sufficient as an embodiment or intelligence.",1900-01-01 02:20:53,observe initiating action feature interpret initiation action perform operation perform make happen see movement limb learn associate thereby model agency feedback right first feedback get first order thing already basically decide think thought thought thought decide change thought observe thought changed sense could say embodiment already right suspect sufficient embodiment intelligence
533,Lex Fridman," Really well put. And so it's not that important, at least at this time, to consider variations in the second order.",1900-01-01 02:21:29,really well put important least time consider variation second order
534,Joscha Bach," Yes, but the thing that you also put... mentioned just now is physics, that you could change in any way you want. So you need an environment that puts up resistance against you. If you if there's nothing to control, you cannot make models. Right? There needs to be a particular way that resists you. And by the way, your motivation is usually outside of your mind. It resists you. Motivation is what gets you up in the morning, even though it would be much less work to stay in bed. Right, so it's basically forcing you to resist the environment and it forces your mind to serve it, to serve this resistance to the environment. So in some sense, it is also putting up resistance against the natural tendency of the mind to not do anything.",1900-01-01 02:21:34,yes thing also put mentioned physic could change way want need environment put resistance nothing control cannot make model right need particular way resists way motivation usually outside mind resists motivation get morning even though would much le work stay bed right basically forcing resist environment force mind serve serve resistance environment sense also putting resistance natural tendency mind anything
535,Lex Fridman," Yeah, but so some of that resistance, just like you describe as motivation, is like in the first order, it's in the mind, some resistance is in the second order, like actual physical objects pushing against you, so on. It seems that the second order stuff in virtual reality could be recreated.",1900-01-01 02:22:16,yeah resistance like describe motivation like first order mind resistance second order like actual physical object pushing seems second order stuff virtual reality could recreated
536,Joscha Bach," Of course, but it might be sufficient that you just do mathematics. And mathematics is already putting up enough resistance against you. So basically, just with an aesthetic motive, this could may be sufficient to form a type of intelligence. It would probably not be a very human intelligence, but it might be one that is already general.",1900-01-01 02:22:31,course might sufficient mathematics mathematics already putting enough resistance basically aesthetic motive could may sufficient form type intelligence would probably human intelligence might one already general
537,Joscha Bach," So to to mess with this zeroth order, maybe first order, what do you think about ideas of brain -computer interfaces? So, again, returning to our friend Elon Musk and NeuraLink. A company that's trying to, of course, there's a lot of trying to cure diseases and so on with the near term, but the long term vision is to add an extra layer to...so basically expand the capacity of the brain connected to the computational world. Do you think, one, that's possible. Two, how does that change the fundamentals of the zeroth order in the first order?",1900-01-01 02:22:50,mess zeroth order maybe first order think idea brain computer interface returning friend elon musk neuralink company trying course lot trying cure disease near term long term vision add extra layer basically expand capacity brain connected computational world think one possible two change fundamental zeroth order first order
538,Joscha Bach," It's technically possible, but I don't see that the FDA would ever allow me to drill holes in my skull, to interface my neocortex the way Elon Musk envisions. So at the moment I can do horrible things to mice, but I'm not able to do useful things to people, except maybe, at some point down the line, in medical applications. So this thing that we are envisioning, which means recreational and creational brain-computer interfaces, are probably not going to happen in the present legal system.",1900-01-01 02:23:24,technically possible see fda would ever allow drill hole skull interface neocortex way elon musk envisions moment horrible thing mouse able useful thing people except maybe point line medical application thing envisioning mean recreational creational brain computer interface probably going happen present legal system
539,Lex Fridman," I love it how I'm asking you out there, philosophical and sort of engineering questions and for the first time ever, you jumped to the legal FDA.",1900-01-01 02:23:52,love asking philosophical sort engineering question first time ever jumped legal fda
540,Joscha Bach," There would be enough people that would be crazy enough to have holes drilled in their skull to try a new type of brain computer interface, right?",1900-01-01 02:24:04,would enough people would crazy enough hole drilled skull try new type brain computer interface right
541,Joscha Bach," But also if it works, FDA will approve it. I mean, yes, you're... It's like a... Because, you know, I work a lot with autonomous vehicles. Yes. You can say there's going to be very difficult regulatory process of approving autonomos [vehicles], but it doesn't mean autonomous vehicles are never going to happen .So...",1900-01-01 02:24:10,also work fda approve mean yes like know work lot autonomous vehicle yes say going difficult regulatory process approving autonomos vehicle mean autonomous vehicle never going happen
542,Joscha Bach," No, they will totally happen, as soon as we create jobs for at least two lawyers and one regulator per car.",1900-01-01 02:24:26,totally happen soon create job least two lawyer one regulator per car
543,Joscha Bach," Yes, lawyers... that's actually like lawyers as the fundamental substrate of reality.",1900-01-01 02:24:33,yes lawyer actually like lawyer fundamental substrate reality
544,Joscha Bach," In the US. It's a very weird system. It's not universal in the world. It's a... The law is a very interesting software once you realize it, right? These circuits are in some sense streams of software and this is largely works by exception handling. So you make decisions on the ground and they get synchronized with the next level structure as soon as an exception is being thrown.",1900-01-01 02:24:42,u weird system universal world law interesting software realize right circuit sense stream software largely work exception handling make decision ground get synchronized next level structure soon exception thrown
545,Joscha Bach," It's a yeah, so.",1900-01-01 02:25:00,yeah
546,Joscha Bach," So it escalates the exception handling. The process is very expensive, especially since it's incentivizes the lawyers for producing a lot of work for lawyers.",1900-01-01 02:25:02,escalates exception handling process expensive especially since incentivizes lawyer producing lot work lawyer
547,Joscha Bach," Yes. So the exceptions are actually incentivized for for for firing often. But but to return outside of lawyers, is there anything fundamentally like is there anything interesting, insightful about the possibility of this extra layer of intelligence added to the brain?",1900-01-01 02:25:11,yes exception actually incentivized firing often return outside lawyer anything fundamentally like anything interesting insightful possibility extra layer intelligence added brain
548,Joscha Bach," I do think so, but I don't think that you need, uh, technically invasive procedures to do so. We can already interface with other people by observing them very, very closely and getting in some kind of empathetic resonance. And I'm a nerd so I'm not very good at this, but I notice that people are able to do this to some degree. And it basically means that we model an interface layer of the other person in real time. And it works despite our neurons being slow, because most of the things that we do are built on periodic processes. So you just need to etrain yourself with the oscillation that happens, and if the oscillation itself changes slowly enough, you can basically follow along.",1900-01-01 02:25:32,think think need uh technically invasive procedure already interface people observing closely getting kind empathetic resonance nerd good notice people able degree basically mean model interface layer person real time work despite neuron slow thing built periodic process need etrain oscillation happens oscillation change slowly enough basically follow along
549,Joscha Bach," Right. But the bandwidth of that interaction, the... You know, it seems like you can do a lot more computation when there's...",1900-01-01 02:26:10,right bandwidth interaction know seems like lot computation
550,Joscha Bach," Of course. But the other thing is that the bandwidth that our brain, our own mind is running on is actually quite slow. So the number of thoughts that I can productively think in any given day is quite limited.",1900-01-01 02:26:20,course thing bandwidth brain mind running actually quite slow number thought productively think given day quite limited
551,Joscha Bach, But it's much...,1900-01-01 02:26:32,much
552,Joscha Bach," If I had the discipline to write it down and the speed to write it down, maybe it would be a book every day or so.

It's something that they can put out in a second.",1900-01-01 02:26:33,discipline write speed write maybe would book every day think computer build magnitude operate right would nothing something put second
553,Joscha Bach," Well, I don't know. So as possible, sort of the number of thoughts you have in your brain is it could be several orders of magnitude higher than what you're possibly able to express through your fingers or through your voice.",1900-01-01 02:26:47,well know possible sort number thought brain could several order magnitude higher possibly able express finger voice

556,Lex Fridman," well, how do you know that?",1900-01-01 02:27:04,well know
557,Joscha Bach," Because they have to control the same problems every day. When I walk, they are going to be processes in my brain, that model my walking pattern and regulate them and so on. But it's going to be pretty much the same every day.",1900-01-01 02:27:06,control problem every day walk going process brain model walking pattern regulate going pretty much every day

560,Joscha Bach," But I'm talking about an intellectual reason. I'm thinking... So the question, what is the best system of government? So you sit down and start thinking about that. One of the constraints is that you don't have access to a lot of like you have access to a lot of facts, a lot of studies.. you have to do... you always have to interface with something else to learn more to to aid in your reasoning process. If you can directly access all of Wikipedia in trying to understand what is the best form of government, then every thought won't be stuck in a ... Like every thought that requires some extra piece of information, we will be able to grab it really quickly. That that's the possibility of, if the bottleneck is literally the information that, you know, the bottleneck of breakthrough ideas is just being able to quickly access huge amounts of information, then the possibility of connecting your brain to the computer could lead to totally new, like, you know, totally new breakthroughs. You can think of mathematicians being able to, you know, just up the orders of magnitude of power in their reasoning about mathematical proofs.",1900-01-01 02:27:18,talking intellectual reason thinking question best system government sit start thinking one constraint access lot like access lot fact lot study always interface something else learn aid reasoning process directly access wikipedia trying understand best form government every thought stuck like every thought requires extra piece information able grab really quickly possibility bottleneck literally information know bottleneck breakthrough idea able quickly access huge amount information possibility connecting brain computer could lead totally new like know totally new breakthrough think mathematician able know order magnitude power reasoning mathematical proof
561,Joscha Bach," What if humanity has already discovered the optimal form of government through evolutionary process. There is an evolution going on, and so what we discover is that maybe the problem of government doesn't have stable solutions for us as a species because we are not designed in such a way that we can make everybody conform to them. So but there could be solutions that work under given circumstances or that are the best for certain environment and depends on, for instance, the primary forms of ownership and the means of production. So if the main means of production is land and then there are forms of government will be regulated by the landowners and you get a monarchy.",1900-01-01 02:28:25,humanity already discovered optimal form government evolutionary process evolution going discover maybe problem government stable solution u specie designed way make everybody conform could solution work given circumstance best certain environment depends instance primary form ownership mean production main mean production land form government regulated landowner get monarchy
562,Joscha Bach," If you also want to have a form of government in which a subset... you depend on some form of slavery, for instance, where the peasants have to work very long hours for very little gain so very few people can have plumbing, then maybe you need to promise them that you get paid in the afterlife, the overtime. Right? So you need a theocracy. And so for much of human history in the West, you had a combination of monarchy and theocracy.",1900-01-01 02:29:05,also want form government subset depend form slavery instance peasant work long hour little gain people plumbing maybe need promise get paid afterlife overtime right need theocracy much human history west combination monarchy theocracy
563,Joscha Bach," That was our form of governance. Right? At the same time, the Catholic Church implemented game theoretic principles. I recently reread Thomas Aquinas. It's very interesting to see this, because he was not dualist. He was translating Aristotle in a particular way for designing an operating system for the Catholic society. And he says that basically people are animals and very much the same way as Aristotle envisions, which basically organism with cybernetic control. And then he says that there are additional rational principles that humans can discover and everybody can discover them so there are universal. If you are sane you, should understand, you said to submit to them because you can rationally deduce them. And these principles are roughly: you should be willing to self-regulate correctly. You should be willing to do correct social regulation, inter-organismic. You should be willing to act on your models so you have skin in the game. And you should have goal rationality, you should be choosing the right goals to work on. And so basically these three rational principles, goal rationality he calls prudence or wisdom, social regulation is justice, the correct social one, and the internal regulation is temperance. And this thing, willingness to act on your models is courage. Mm hmm. And then he says that there are additionally to these four cardinal virtues, three divine virtues. And these three divine virtues cannot be rationally deduced but they reveal themselves by the harmony, which means if you assume them and you extrapolate what's going to happen, you will see that that makes sense. And it's often been misunderstood, as God has to tell you that these are the things. So they're basically there's something nefarious going on. The Christian conspiracy forces you to believe some guy with a long beard that they discovered this. But, uh, so these principles are relatively simple. Again, you need... its for high level organization, for the resulting civilization that you form, a commitment to unity, so basically you serve this higher, larger thing, this structural principle on the next level. And he calls that faith. Then there needs to be a commitment to a shared purpose. Basically this global reward that you try to figure out what that should be and how you can facilitate this and this is love. The commitment to a shared purpose is the core of love. Right. You see the sacred thing that is more important than your own organismic interests in the other. And you serve this together and this is how you see the sacred and the other. And the last one is hope, which means you need to be willing to act on that principle without getting rewards in the here and now because it doesn't exist yet. Then you start out building the civilization. Right. So you need to be able to do this in the absence of its actual existence yet so it can come into being.",1900-01-01 02:29:31,form governance right time catholic church implemented game theoretic principle recently reread thomas aquinas interesting see dualist translating aristotle particular way designing operating system catholic society say basically people animal much way aristotle envisions basically organism cybernetic control say additional rational principle human discover everybody discover universal sane understand said submit rationally deduce principle roughly willing self regulate correctly willing correct social regulation inter organismic willing act model skin game goal rationality choosing right goal work basically three rational principle goal rationality call prudence wisdom social regulation justice correct social one internal regulation temperance thing willingness act model courage mm hmm say additionally four cardinal virtue three divine virtue three divine virtue cannot rationally deduced reveal harmony mean assume extrapolate going happen see make sense often misunderstood god tell thing basically something nefarious going christian conspiracy force believe guy long beard discovered uh principle relatively simple need high level organization resulting civilization form commitment unity basically serve higher larger thing structural principle next level call faith need commitment shared purpose basically global reward try figure facilitate love commitment shared purpose core love right see sacred thing important organismic interest serve together see sacred last one hope mean need willing act principle without getting reward exist yet start building civilization right need able absence actual existence yet come
564,Joscha Bach," So, yes. So the way comes into being is by you accepting those notions and then you see these three divine concepts and you see them realized that",1900-01-01 02:32:21,yes way come accepting notion see three divine concept see realized
565,Joscha Bach," Divine is a loaded concept in our world, because we are outside of this cult and we are still scarred from breaking free of it. But the idea is basically, we need to have a civilization that acts as an intentional agent, like an insect state. And we are not actually a tribal species, we are state building species. And what enabled state building is basically the formation of religious states and other forms of rule-based administration in which the individual doesn't matter as much as the rule or the higher goal.",1900-01-01 02:32:31,divine loaded concept world outside cult still scarred breaking free idea basically need civilization act intentional agent like insect state actually tribal specie state building specie enabled state building basically formation religious state form rule based administration individual matter much rule higher goal
566,Joscha Bach, Right.,1900-01-01 02:32:59,right
567,Joscha Bach," We got there via the question, what's the optimal form of governance? So I don't think that catholicism is the optimal form of governance because it's obviously on the way out. Right? So it is for the present type of society that we are in, religious institutions don't seem to be optimal to organize us. So what we discovered right now that we live in in the West is democracy. And democracy is the rule of oligarchs that are the people that currently own the means of production, that is administered not by the oligarchs themselves, because they there's too much disruption. Right. There's so much innovation that we have in every generation new means of production that we invent. And corporations die usually after 30 years or so. And something other takes a leading role in our societies. So it's administered by institutions. And these institutions themselves are not elected, but they provide continuity and they are led by electable politicians. And this makes it possible that you can adapt to change without having to kill people. Right. So you can tell, for instance, of a change in government if people think that the current government is too corrupt or is not up to date, you can just elect new people. Or if a journalist finds out something inconvenient about the institution and the institution is... has no plan B like in Russia, the journalist has to die. This is what... when you run a society by the deep state. So ideally you have an administration layer that you can change, if something bad happens. Right. So you will have a continuity in the whole thing. And this is the system that we came up in in the West. And the way it's set up in the US is largely a result of low level models. It's mostly just second third order consequences that people are modeling and the design of these institutions. It's a relatively young society that doesn't really take care of the downstream effects of many of the decisions that are being made. And I suspect that AI can help with this in a way, if you can fix the incentives. The society of the US, is as a society of cheaters.

You can, for instance, suggests unsustainable business models and implement them.",1900-01-01 02:35:01,basically people thing know wrong acceptable thing know wrong society certain degree instance suggests unsustainable business model implement

571,Lex Fridman," Yes. In the US, this is seen as a good thing, largely.",1900-01-01 02:35:17,yes u seen good thing largely
572,Lex Fridman, Yes,1900-01-01 02:35:20,yes
573,Joscha Bach," And this is different from other societies. So, for instance, social mobility is an aspect of this. Social mobility is the result of individual innovation that would not be sustainable at scale for everybody else. Normally, you should not go up, you should go deep. Right. We need bakers and need very, very good bakers. But in a society that innovates, maybe you can replace all the bakers with a really good machine. and that's not a bad thing. And it's a thing that made US so successful. Right. But it also means that the US is not optimizing for sustainability, but for innovation.",1900-01-01 02:35:21,different society instance social mobility aspect social mobility result individual innovation would sustainable scale everybody else normally go go deep right need baker need good baker society innovates maybe replace baker really good machine bad thing thing made u successful right also mean u optimizing sustainability innovation

575,Joscha Bach," It has side effects. So basically, if you cheat, you will have a certain layer of toxic sludge that covers everything that is a result of cheating.",1900-01-01 02:35:58,side effect basically cheat certain layer toxic sludge cover everything result cheating
576,Lex Fridman, And we have to unroll this evolutionary process to figure out if these side effects are so damaging that the system is horrible or the benefits actually outweigh the the the negative effects. How do we get to the which system of government as best that was from... I'm trying to trace back the last five minutes...,1900-01-01 02:36:07,unroll evolutionary process figure side effect damaging system horrible benefit actually outweigh negative effect get system government best trying trace back last five minute
577,Joscha Bach," I suspect that we can find a way back to AI by thinking about the way in which our brain has to organize itself. In some sense, our brain is a society of neurons and our mind is a society of behaviors. And they need to be organizing themselves into a structure that implements regulation. And government is social regulation. We often see government as the manifestation of power or local interests, but it's actually a platform for negotiating the conditions of human survival. And this platform emerges over the current needs and possibilities and the trajectory that we have. So given the present state, there are only so many options on how we can move into the next stage without completely disrupting everything. And we mostly agree that it's a bad idea to disrupt everything because it will endanger our food supply for a while and the entire infrastructure and fabric of society. So we do try to find natural transitions and there are not that many natural transitions available at any given point.",1900-01-01 02:36:27,suspect find way back ai thinking way brain organize sense brain society neuron mind society behavior need organizing structure implement regulation government social regulation often see government manifestation power local interest actually platform negotiating condition human survival platform emerges current need possibility trajectory given present state many option move next stage without completely disrupting everything mostly agree bad idea disrupt everything endanger food supply entire infrastructure fabric society try find natural transition many natural transition available given point
578,Lex Fridman, What you mea by natural transitions?,1900-01-01 02:37:27,mea natural transition
579,Joscha Bach, So we try to not to have revolutions if we can help it.,1900-01-01 02:37:28,try revolution help
580,Lex Fridman," Right. So speaking of revolutions and the connection between government systems in the mind, you also said that... you said that in some sense, becoming an adult means you take charge of your emotions. Maybe never said that. Maybe I just made that up. But in the context of the mind, what's the role of emotion and what is it? First of all, what is emotion? What's its role?",1900-01-01 02:37:31,right speaking revolution connection government system mind also said said sense becoming adult mean take charge emotion maybe never said maybe made context mind role emotion first emotion role
581,Joscha Bach," It's several things. So psychologists often distinguish between emotion and feeling. And in common day parlance, we don't.",1900-01-01 02:37:58,several thing psychologist often distinguish emotion feeling common day parlance
582,Joscha Bach," I think that emotion is a configuration of the cognitive system. And that's especially true for the lowest level for the affective state. So when you have an affect, it's the configuration of certain modulation parameters like arousal, valence, your attentional focus, whether it's wide or narrow, intera-reception or extra-reception, and so on. And all these parameters together put you in a certain way that you relate with the environment and to yourself, and this is in some sense an emotional configuration.",1900-01-01 02:38:06,think emotion configuration cognitive system especially true lowest level affective state affect configuration certain modulation parameter like arousal valence attentional focus whether wide narrow intera reception extra reception parameter together put certain way relate environment sense emotional configuration
583,Joscha Bach," And the more narrow sense an emotion is an affective state that has an object. And the relevance of that object is given by motivation. And motivation is a bunch of needs that are associated with rewards, things that give you pleasure and pain. And you don't actually act on your needs, you act on models of your needs. Because when the pleasure and pain manifest, it's too late, you've done everything. So you act on expectations [of] what will give you a pleasure and pain. And these are your purposes. The needs don't form a hierarchy. They just coexist and compete. And your organism has... your brain has to find a dynamic homeostasis between them. But the purposes need to be consistent. So you basically can create a story for your life and make plans. And so we organize them all into hierarchies. And there is not a unique solution for this. Some people eat to make art and other people make art to eat. They might end up doing the same things, but they cooperate in very different ways because the ultimate goals are different and we cooperate based on shared purpose. Everything else that is not cooperation on shared purpose is transactional.",1900-01-01 02:38:33,narrow sense emotion affective state object relevance object given motivation motivation bunch need associated reward thing give pleasure pain actually act need act model need pleasure pain manifest late done everything act expectation give pleasure pain purpose need form hierarchy coexist compete organism brain find dynamic homeostasis purpose need consistent basically create story life make plan organize hierarchy unique solution people eat make art people make art eat might end thing cooperate different way ultimate goal different cooperate based shared purpose everything else cooperation shared purpose transactional
584,Lex Fridman, I don't think I understood that last piece of the achieving the homeostasis. Are you distinguishing between the experience of emotion and the expression of emotion?,1900-01-01 02:39:35,think understood last piece achieving homeostasis distinguishing experience emotion expression emotion
585,Joscha Bach," Of course. So the experience of emotion is a feeling. And in this sense, what you feel is an appraisal that your perceptual system has made of the situation at hand. And it makes this based on your motivation. and on your estimates, not your but of the subconscious geometric parts of your mind that assess the situation in the world with something like a neural network. And this neural network is making itself known to the symbolic parts of your mind, to your conscious attention via mapping them as features into a space.",1900-01-01 02:39:47,course experience emotion feeling sense feel appraisal perceptual system made situation hand make based motivation estimate subconscious geometric part mind ass situation world something like neural network neural network making known symbolic part mind conscious attention via mapping feature space
586,Joscha Bach," So what you will feel about your emotion is a projection usually into your body map. So you might feel anxiety in your solar plexus and you might feel it as a contraction, which is all geometry. Right. Your body map is the space that is always instantiated and always available. So it's a very obvious cheat, if your non-symbolic parts of your brain, try to talk to your symbolic parts of your brain to map the feelings into the body map. And then you perceive them as pleasant or unpleasant, depending on whether the appraisal has a negative or positive valence. And then you have different features of them that give you more knowledge about the nature of what your feelings are. For instance, when you feel connected to other people, you typically feel this in your chest region around your heart, and you feel this is an expansive feeling in which you're reaching out. Right. And it's very intuitive to encode it like this. That's why it's encoded like this for most people.",1900-01-01 02:40:21,feel emotion projection usually body map might feel anxiety solar plexus might feel contraction geometry right body map space always instantiated always available obvious cheat non symbolic part brain try talk symbolic part brain map feeling body map perceive pleasant unpleasant depending whether appraisal negative positive valence different feature give knowledge nature feeling instance feel connected people typically feel chest region around heart feel expansive feeling reaching right intuitive encode like encoded like people
587,Joscha Bach, It's encoded.,1900-01-01 02:41:14,encoded
588,Joscha Bach, It's a code in which the non-symbolic parts of your mind talk to the symbolic ones.,1900-01-01 02:41:15,code non symbolic part mind talk symbolic one
589,Lex Fridman, And then the expression of emotion is then the final step that could be sort of gestural or visual and so on. Thats part of the communication...,1900-01-01 02:41:19,expression emotion final step could sort gestural visual thats part communication
590,Joscha Bach," I suspect this probably evolved as part of an adversarial communication. So as soon as you started to observe the facial expression and posture of others to understand what emotional state they are in, others started to use this as signaling and also to subvert your model of their emotional state. So we now look at the inflections that the difference between the standard face that they're going to make in this situation. Like when you were at a funeral, everybody expects you to make a solemn face, but the solemn face doesn't express whether your sad or not. It just expresses that you understand what face you have to make at a funeral. Nobody should know that you are triumphant. So when you try to read the emotion of another person, you try to look at the delta between a sad, a truly sad expression and the things that are animated making this face behind the curtain.",1900-01-01 02:41:27,suspect probably evolved part adversarial communication soon started observe facial expression posture others understand emotional state others started use signaling also subvert model emotional state look inflection difference standard face going make situation like funeral everybody expects make solemn face solemn face express whether sad express understand face make funeral nobody know triumphant try read emotion another person try look delta sad truly sad expression thing animated making face behind curtain
591,Lex Fridman," So the interesting thing as so having done this, having done this podcast and the video component, one of the things I've learned is that now I'm Russian and I, I just don't know how to express emotion on my face when I see that as weakness. But whatever... The people look to me after you say something, they look to my face to to help them see how they should feel about what he said, which is fascinating, because then they'll often comment on why did you look bored or why did you particularly enjoy that part or why did you whatever. It's a kind of interesting... It makes me cognizant of I'm part, like you're basically saying a bunch of brilliant things, but I'm part of the play that you're the key actor in by making my facial expressions and then and therefore telling the narrative of what the big like the big point is, which is fascinating. Makes me cognizant that I'm supposed to be making facial expressions, even this conversation is hard because my preference would be to wear a mask with sunglasses to where I could just listen.",1900-01-01 02:42:13,interesting thing done done podcast video component one thing learned russian know express emotion face see weakness whatever people look say something look face help see feel said fascinating often comment look bored particularly enjoy part whatever kind interesting make cognizant part like basically saying bunch brilliant thing part play key actor making facial expression therefore telling narrative big like big point fascinating make cognizant supposed making facial expression even conversation hard preference would wear mask sunglass could listen

593,Joscha Bach, Which is...,1900-01-01 02:43:19,
594,Joscha Bach," I understand this because it's intrusive to interact with others this way. And basically Eastern European society have a taboo against that, and especially Russia and the further you go to the east. And in the US, it's the opposite. You're expected to be hyper animated in your face and you're also expected to show positive effect. and if you show positive effect without a good reason in Russia, people will think you are a stupid, unsophisticated person.",1900-01-01 02:43:19,understand intrusive interact others way basically eastern european society taboo especially russia go east u opposite expected hyper animated face also expected show positive effect show positive effect without good reason russia people think stupid unsophisticated person

Everything above the lowest 10 percent is: it's amazing. And for Russians, everything below the top 10 percent is: it's terrible. And then everything except the top percent is: I don't like it.

600,Joscha Bach," But there's a deeper aspect to this. It's also how you construct meaning. In the US, usually you focus on the positive aspects and you just suppress the negative aspects. And our Eastern European traditions, we emphasize the fact that if you hold something above the waterline, you also need to put something below the waterline because existence by itself is at best neutral.",1900-01-01 02:44:43,deeper aspect also construct meaning u usually focus positive aspect suppress negative aspect eastern european tradition emphasize fact hold something waterline also need put something waterline existence best neutral

602,Joscha Bach," There are moments of beauty, but these moments of beauty are inextricably linked to the reality of suffering.

604,Joscha Bach," It's an interesting thing when you raise children in the U.S. and you, in some sense, preserve the identity of the intellectual and cultural traditions that are embedded in your own families. And your daughter asks you about Ariel the mermaid, and asks you, why is Ariel not allowed to play with the humans? And you tell her the truth. She is a Siren. Sirens eat people, you don't play with your food, it does not end well. And then you tell her the original story, which is not the one by Andersen, which is the romantic one. And there's a much darker one.",1900-01-01 02:45:47,interesting thing raise child u sense preserve identity intellectual cultural tradition embedded family daughter asks ariel mermaid asks ariel allowed play human tell truth siren siren eat people play food end well tell original story one andersen romantic one much darker one

And she says, OK, but the deal is you cannot have any other woman. If you marry somebody else, even though you cannot be with me, because obviously you cannot breathe underwater and I have things to do than managing your kingdom as you have here, you will die. And eventually, after a few years, he falls in love with some princess and marries her and she shows up and quietly goes into his chamber and nobody is able to stop her or willing to do so because she is fierce. And she comes quietly and sad out of his chamber and they ask her, what has happened, what did you do? And she said, I kissed him to death.",1900-01-01 02:46:21,undine mermaid water woman life ground river meet prince fall love prince really really want say ok deal cannot woman marry somebody else even though cannot obviously cannot breathe underwater thing managing kingdom die eventually year fall love princess marries show quietly go chamber nobody able stop willing fierce come quietly sad chamber ask happened said kissed death

610,Joscha Bach," And you know, the Andersson story, right? In the Andersson story, the mermaid is playing with this prince that she saves and she falls in love with him and she cannot live out there. So she is giving up her voice and her tail for a human-like appearance so she can walk among the humans. But this guy does not recognize that she is the one that he should marry. Instead, he marries somebody who has a kingdom and economical and political relationships to his own kingdom and so on, as he should.",1900-01-01 02:47:10,know andersson story right andersson story mermaid playing prince save fall love cannot live giving voice tail human like appearance walk among human guy recognize one marry instead marries somebody kingdom economical political relationship kingdom

614,Joscha Bach," My own problem is, with this, of course, that I read Oscar Wilde before I read the other thing. So I am indoctrinated, inoculated with this romanticism. And I think that the mermaid is right. You sacrifice your life for romantic love, that's what you do. Because if you are confronted with either serving the machine and doing the obviously right thing and the economic and social and all other human incentives, that's wrong.

618,Joscha Bach," Yes. But happiness itself is not important. Happiness is like a cookie. When you are a child you think cookies are very important and you want to have all the cookies in the world. You look forward to being an adult because then you have as many cookies as you want, right?",1900-01-01 02:48:38,yes happiness important happiness like cookie child think cooky important want cooky world look forward adult many cooky want right
619,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 02:48:51,yes
620,Joscha Bach," But as an adult, you realize the cookie is a tool. It's a tool to make you eat vegetables.

621,Lex Fridman," Yes, but then the cookie, the scarcity of a cookie... If scarcity is enforced. Nevertheless, the pleasure comes from the scarcity.",1900-01-01 02:49:03,yes cookie scarcity cookie scarcity enforced nevertheless pleasure come scarcity
622,Joscha Bach," Yes, but the happiness is a cookie that your brain bakes for itself. It's not made by the environment. The environment cannot make you happy. It's your appraisal of the environment that makes you happy. And if you can change the appraisal of the environment, which you can learn to, then you can create arbitrary states of happiness. And some meditators fall into this trap. So they discover the room, this basement room in their brain where the cookies are made and they indulge and stuff themselves and after a few months, it gets really old. And the big crisis of meaning comes. Because they thought before that their unhappiness was the result of not being happy enough so they fix this, right? They can release the neurotransmitters at will, if they train. And then the crisis of meaning pops up at a deeper layer. And the question is, why do I live? How can I make a sustainable civilization that is meaningful to me? How can I insert myself into this? And this was the problem that you couldn't solve in the first place.",1900-01-01 02:49:11,yes happiness cookie brain bakes made environment environment cannot make happy appraisal environment make happy change appraisal environment learn create arbitrary state happiness meditators fall trap discover room basement room brain cooky made indulge stuff month get really old big crisis meaning come thought unhappiness result happy enough fix right release neurotransmitter train crisis meaning pop deeper layer question live make sustainable civilization meaningful insert problem solve first place
623,Lex Fridman," But at the end of all this, let me then ask that same question, what is the answer to that? What could possible answer be: the meaning of life. What what could an answer be? What is it to you?",1900-01-01 02:50:04,end let ask question answer could possible answer meaning life could answer
624,Joscha Bach," I think that if you look at the meaning of life, you look at what the cell is. The life is the cell.",1900-01-01 02:50:17,think look meaning life look cell life cell
625,Lex Fridman, The original cell.,1900-01-01 02:50:24,original cell
626,Joscha Bach," Yes. Or this principle, the cell. It's this self-organizing thing that can participate in evolution. In order to make it work, it's a molecular machine, it needs a self replicator, a negentropy extractor and a Turing machine. If any of these parts is missing, you don't have a cell and it is not living, right? And life is basically the emergent complexity over that principle. Once you have this intelligent super molecule, the cell, there is very little that you cannot make it to. It's probably the optimal Computronium, especially in terms of resilience. It's very hard to sterilize the planet once it's infected with life.",1900-01-01 02:50:24,yes principle cell self organizing thing participate evolution order make work molecular machine need self replicator negentropy extractor turing machine part missing cell living right life basically emergent complexity principle intelligent super molecule cell little cannot make probably optimal computronium especially term resilience hard sterilize planet infected life
627,Lex Fridman, So its active function of these three components or the super cell of cell is present in the cell is present in us. And it's just...,1900-01-01 02:50:58,active function three component super cell cell present cell present u
628,Joscha Bach," We are just an expression of the cell, it's certain layer of complexity in the organization of cells. So, in a way, it's tempting to think of the cell as a Von Neumann probe. If you want to build intelligence on other planets, the best way to do this is to infect them for cells. And wait for long enough, and there's a reasonable chance the stuff is going to evolve into an information processing principle that is general enough to become sentient",1900-01-01 02:51:08,expression cell certain layer complexity organization cell way tempting think cell von neumann probe want build intelligence planet best way infect cell wait long enough reasonable chance stuff going evolve information processing principle general enough become sentient
629,Lex Fridman," With a ... That idea is very akin to sort of the the same dream and beautiful ideas that are expressed, the cellular automata in their most simple mathematical form. If you just inject the system with some basic mechanisms of replication. So on basic rules, amazing things would emerge",1900-01-01 02:51:32,idea akin sort dream beautiful idea expressed cellular automaton simple mathematical form inject system basic mechanism replication basic rule amazing thing would emerge
630,Joscha Bach," And the cell is able to do something that James Hardy calls existential design. He points out that in technical design, we go from the outside in. We work in highly controlled environment in which everything is deterministic, like our computers, our or labs, or our engineering workshops. And then we use this determinism to implement a particular kind of function that we dream up and that seamlessly interfaces with all the other deterministic functions that we already have in our world. So it's basically from the outside in.",1900-01-01 02:51:49,cell able something james hardy call existential design point technical design go outside work highly controlled environment everything deterministic like computer lab engineering workshop use determinism implement particular kind function dream seamlessly interface deterministic function already world basically outside
631,Joscha Bach," And biological systems design from the inside out as seed will come a seedling by taking some of the relatively unorganized matter around it and turn it into its own structure and thereby subdue the environment. And cells can cooperate if they can rely on other cells having a similar organization that is already compatible. But unless that's there, the cell needs to divide to create that structure by itself. Right. So it's a self organizing principle that works on a somewhat chaotic environment. And the purpose of life, in this sense, is to produce complexity. And the complexity allows you to harvest entropy gradients that you couldn't harvest without the complexity. And in this sense intelligence and life are very strongly connected, because the purpose of intelligence is to allow control under conditions of complexity. So basically, you shift the boundary between the ordered systems into the realm of chaos.",1900-01-01 02:52:18,biological system design inside seed come seedling taking relatively unorganized matter around turn structure thereby subdue environment cell cooperate rely cell similar organization already compatible unless cell need divide create structure right self organizing principle work somewhat chaotic environment purpose life sense produce complexity complexity allows harvest entropy gradient harvest without complexity sense intelligence life strongly connected purpose intelligence allow control condition complexity basically shift boundary ordered system realm chaos
632,Joscha Bach," You build bridgeheads into chaos with complexity. And this is what we are doing. This is not necessarily a deeper meaning. I think the meaning that we have priors for, that we have evolved for, outside of the priors, there is no meaning. Meaning only exists if a mind projects it, right?",1900-01-01 02:53:13,build bridgehead chaos complexity necessarily deeper meaning think meaning prior evolved outside prior meaning meaning exists mind project right
633,Joscha Bach, Yeah [the narratives],1900-01-01 02:53:27,yeah narrative
634,Joscha Bach, that is probably civilization. I think that what feels most meaningful to me is to try to build and maintain a sustainable civilization,1900-01-01 02:53:28,probably civilization think feel meaningful try build maintain sustainable civilization
635,Lex Fridman," And taking a slight step outside of that... We talked about a man with a beard and God. But something. Some mechanism perhaps must have planted the seed, the initial seed of the cell. Do you think there is a God? What is a God? And what would that look like...",1900-01-01 02:53:37,taking slight step outside talked man beard god something mechanism perhaps must planted seed initial seed cell think god god would look like
636,Joscha Bach, So if there was no spontaneous abiogenesis in the sense that the first cell formed by some happy random accidents where the molecules just happen to be in the right consolation to each other.,1900-01-01 02:54:00,spontaneous abiogenesis sense first cell formed happy random accident molecule happen right consolation
637,Lex Fridman," But there could also be the mechanism of that allows for the random. I mean, is like turtles all the way down. There seems to be there has to be a head turtle at the bottom...",1900-01-01 02:54:12,could also mechanism allows random mean like turtle way seems head turtle bottom
638,Joscha Bach," Lets consider something really wild. Imagine: is it possible that a gas giant could become intelligent? What would that involve? So imagine that you have vortices that spontaneously emerge on the gas giants, like big storm systems that endure for thousands of years. And some of these storm systems produce electromagnetic fields because some of the clouds are ferromagnetic or something. And as a result, they can change how certain clouds react rather than other clouds, and thereby produce some self stabilising patterns that eventually lead to regulation, feedback loops, nested feedback loops and control.",1900-01-01 02:54:23,let consider something really wild imagine possible gas giant could become intelligent would involve imagine vortex spontaneously emerge gas giant like big storm system endure thousand year storm system produce electromagnetic field cloud ferromagnetic something result change certain cloud react rather cloud thereby produce self stabilising pattern eventually lead regulation feedback loop nested feedback loop control
639,Joscha Bach," So imagine you have such a thing, that basically has emergent, self-sustaining, self-organizing complexity. And at some point this wakes up and realizes and basically Lems' Solaris: I am a thinking planet. But I will not replicate because I cannot recreate the conditions of my own existence somewhere else. I'm just basically an intelligence that has spontaneously formed because it could. And now it builds Von Neumann probe. And the best Von Neumann probe for such a thing might be the cell. So maybe it will because it's very, very clever and very enduring, create cells and sends them out and one of them has infected our planet. I'm not suggesting that is the case, but it would be compatible with the panspermia hypothesis. And with my intuition that abiogenesis is very unlikely. It's possible, but you probably need to draw the cosmic dice very often, maybe more often than the other planetary surfaces. I don't know.",1900-01-01 02:54:55,imagine thing basically emergent self sustaining self organizing complexity point wake realizes basically lem solaris thinking planet replicate cannot recreate condition existence somewhere else basically intelligence spontaneously formed could build von neumann probe best von neumann probe thing might cell maybe clever enduring create cell sends one infected planet suggesting case would compatible panspermia hypothesis intuition abiogenesis unlikely possible probably need draw cosmic dice often maybe often planetary surface know
640,Lex Fridman, So God is just a large enough... A system that's large enough that allows randomness?,1900-01-01 02:55:46,god large enough system large enough allows randomness
641,Joscha Bach," No, I don't think that God has anything to do with creation. I think it's a mistranslation of the Talmud into the Catholic mythology. I think that Genesis is actually the childhood memories of a God. So when...",1900-01-01 02:55:54,think god anything creation think mistranslation talmud catholic mythology think genesis actually childhood memory god
642,Joscha Bach, Sorry the Genesis is ...?,1900-01-01 02:56:06,sorry genesis
643,Joscha Bach, The childhood memories of a God. It's basically a mind that is remembering how it came into being. And we typically interpret Genesis as the creation of a physical universe by a supernatural being.,1900-01-01 02:56:08,childhood memory god basically mind remembering came typically interpret genesis creation physical universe supernatural
644,Lex Fridman, Yes.,1900-01-01 02:56:20,yes
645,Joscha Bach," And I think when you read it, there is light and darkness that has been created and then you discover sky and ground, you create them. You construct the plants and the animals and you give everything their names and so on. That's basic cognitive development. It's a sequence of steps that every mind has to go through when it makes sense of the world. And when you have children you can see how initially they distinguish light and darkness. And then they make out directions in it, and they discover sky and ground, and they discover the plants and the animals, and they give everything their name. And it's a creative process that happens in every mind because it's not given, right? Your mind has to invent these structures to make sense of the patterns on your retina.",1900-01-01 02:56:20,think read light darkness created discover sky ground create construct plant animal give everything name basic cognitive development sequence step every mind go make sense world child see initially distinguish light darkness make direction discover sky ground discover plant animal give everything name creative process happens every mind given right mind invent structure make sense pattern retina
646,Joscha Bach," Also, if there was some big nerd who set up a server and runs this world on it, this would not create a special relationship between us and the nerd. This nerd would not have the magical power to give meaning to our existence. Right. So this equation of a creator God with the God of meaning is a sleight of hand. You shouldn't do it.",1900-01-01 02:57:04,also big nerd set server run world would create special relationship u nerd nerd would magical power give meaning existence right equation creator god god meaning sleight hand
647,Joscha Bach," The other one that is done in Catholicism is the equation of the first mover, the prime mover of Aristotle, which is basically the automaton that runs the universe. Aristotle says, if things are moving, and things seem to be moving here, something must move them, right? If something moves them, something must move the thing that is moving. So there must be a prime mover. This idea, to say that this prime mover is a supernatural being is complete nonsense, right?",1900-01-01 02:57:24,one done catholicism equation first mover prime mover aristotle basically automaton run universe aristotle say thing moving thing seem moving something must move right something move something must move thing moving must prime mover idea say prime mover supernatural complete nonsense right
648,Joscha Bach," It's an automaton in the simplest case. So we have to explain the enormity that this automaton exists at all. But again, we don't have any possibility to infer anything about its properties, except that it's able to produce change in information. So there needs to be some kind of computational principle, this is all there is. But to say this automaton is identical again with the creator of first cause or with the thing that gives meaning to our life is confusion.",1900-01-01 02:57:49,automaton simplest case explain enormity automaton exists possibility infer anything property except able produce change information need kind computational principle say automaton identical creator first cause thing give meaning life confusion
649,Joscha Bach," No, I think that what we perceive is the higher being that we are part of and the higher being that we are part of is the civilisation. It's the thing in which we have a similar relationship as the cell has to our body. And we have this prior because we have evolved to organize in these structures. So basically the Christian God in its natural form, without the mythology, if you undress it, is basically the platonic form of the civilisation.",1900-01-01 02:58:18,think perceive higher part higher part civilisation thing similar relationship cell body prior evolved organize structure basically christian god natural form without mythology undress basically platonic form civilisation
650,Joscha Bach, Is the is the ideal?,1900-01-01 02:58:47,ideal
651,Joscha Bach," Yes, it's this idea that you try to approximate when you interact with others, not based on your incentives, but on what you think is right.",1900-01-01 02:58:49,yes idea try approximate interact others based incentive think right
652,Lex Fridman," Wow! We covered a lot of ground and we left with one of my favorite lines, and there's many, which is, happiness is a cookie that the brain bakes itself.
